  <p class="about">
    I'm a content-creator by nature. I'm working on websites, coding-related
    projects, and my blog now, but I've also written three screenplays, three
    pilots, and I'm finishing up a memoir. I'm all about getting creative.<br /><br />
<<<<<<< HEAD
    I'm a mom to four young kids, and I've spent ten years of my life adjuncting
    in various university English departments. I'm practically doing a 180 here
    learning to code, so I'm sharing my failures, successes, and everything that
    falls in between.<br /><br />
    I graduated from Flatiron School Software Engineering program, where I
    learned Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux. I've spent most
    of the last year working with React, learning how to dive into existing
    codebases, refactor code, use hooks, write tests, use Storybook, and well a
    lot more. Let's just say I learned a ton from 2019-2020.<br /><br />
    One of my favorite parts of coding is the ability to use code for social
    good. I'm particularly interested in creating access to education, finding
    solutions to community and medical challenges, and building supportive
    communities, which brings me to my other favorite part of coding: being a
    part of the community. <br /><br />
    As part of the tech community, I am active on Twitter and in slack groups,
    speak on podcasts, and participate in organizations that promote coding. In
    August, I spoke at Mid-Atlantic Developers Conference on Community and
    Gatekeepers.
