<div class="blurb">

<p>I'm a mom to four young kids, and I've spent the last ten years of my life adjuncting in various university English departments. I'm a content-creator by nature.
  I've written three screenplays, three pilots, now I'm working on this blog--which I love--and I'm hoping to do a podcast and webseries in the future!
I'm practically doing a 180 here learning to code, so I'm sharing my failures, successes, and
everything that falls in between.</p>
