<h1> Mothercoder</h1>
<p>I'm a mom to four young kids, and I've spent the last ten years teaching English at the college level. 
I decided to quit teaching to devote more time to coding, and I'll be done May of 2018. 
I'm practically doing a 180 here by learning to code, so I wanted to share my failures, successes, and 
everything that falls in between.</p>
