  <p class="about">
    I'm a content-creator by nature. I'm working on websites, coding-related
    projects, and my blog now, but I've also written three screenplays, three
    pilots, and I'm finishing up a memoir. I'm all about getting creative.<br /><br />
    I'm a mom to four young kids, and I've spent the last ten years of my life
    adjuncting in various university English departments. As a career-changer, I
    know the challenges of the journey, so I'm sharing my failures, successes,
    and everything that falls in between.<br /><br />
    I graduated from Flatiron School Software Engineering program, where I
    learned Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux. One of my
    favorite parts of coding is the ability to use code for social good. I'm
    particularly interested in creating access to education, finding solutions
    to community and medical challenges, and building supportive communities,
    which brings me to my other favorite part of coding: being a part of the
    community. <br /><br />
    As part of the tech community, I am active on Twitter and in slack groups,
    speak on podcasts, and participate in organizations that promote coding. In
    August, I spoke at my first conference, Mid-Atlantic Developers Conference.
