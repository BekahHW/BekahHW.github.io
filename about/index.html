<div class="blurb">

<p>I'm a content-creator by nature. I'm working on websites, coding-related projects, and my blog now,
but I've also written three screenplays, three pilots, and I'm hoping to do a podcast and webseries in the future! I'm all about getting creative.
I'm a mom to four young kids,
and I've spent the last ten years of my life adjuncting in various university English departments.
I'm practically doing a 180 here learning to code, so I'm sharing my failures, successes, and
everything that falls in between.</p>
