        <title>How I accidentally interviewed for two jobs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard people say they interview for practice or for fun. I am not one of those people. I am the opposite of those people. On top of being not one of those people, I am also a person who is incredibly satisfied with my job and life, except as an independent contractor my family and I pay out of pocket for medical insurance. And I have over $70,000 of medical bills sitting on my desk with more coming. So when someone from a notable company in tech reached out to me and encouraged me to apply to a DevRel position, and then when I talked to a friend in tech who encouraged me to apply for a senior DevRel position, I did. This is the first in a series of posts on what I’ve learned through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-ok-to-say-no-or-recommend-someone-else&quot;&gt;It’s Ok to say no or recommend someone else&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an early-career developer who gets maybe more DMs than most early-career devs because of what I’ve done with &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve had a number of people reach out and ask me to apply for jobs. Usually, I decline and recommend someone else I know. If you look at the job, and it’s not something that’s interesting, within your desired salary, or you find out more about the team and you don’t think you’d be a good fit, it’s ok to pass or to recommend someone else you think would be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-your-research-and-reach-out-to-people-you-trust&quot;&gt;Do Your Research and Reach out to People you Trust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming into tech, I’ve always said that my dream job is working with good people. And that’s 100% true for me. I have been working with good–actually amazing–people. I’ve also seen so many devs fall into really toxic work environments. So if I’m going to leave a situation I’m happy with, I’m going to do my research. For me this means learning about the people on the teams, the companies, and DMing people who I know in tech and asking them about the teams, companies, and/or positions. Through these DMs, I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some tough questions to ask to gauge the strength of the teams and to avoid workplace toxicity;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to gauge the sincerity of responses;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How current teams functioned within the organization and how that would impact the position;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What the current team dynamics are;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About the projects, processes, and structures the teams use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ask-direct-questions&quot;&gt;Ask Direct Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I wasn’t actively looking for work, I came to the process with a privileged position. I could afford to ask questions that some might be afraid to ask initially. Some of the questions I asked prior to the interviews were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s the salary range?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Could I continue organizing Virtual Coffee as part of the job?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are your current pain points?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the schedule flexible?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does the health insurance like?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we talk about the title?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; interviewing them as well. If you have values or standards that are important to you, it’s ok to be selective from the very beginning. In fact, it was the openness and honesty of the answers that made me feel comfortable going further in the process, which I’ll talk about in my next post, because these weren’t quick and simple processes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes from Twitter Spaces on Community and Remote Work</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My notes from the last two weeks of Twitter spaces I hosted. These are not all my ideas, and I might not agree with them all. But, I wanted to share what we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;community--career&quot;&gt;Community + Career&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-be-a-part-of-a-community&quot;&gt;Why should you be a part of a community?*&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helps with career guidance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports you as you grow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows for networking opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates a safe space for exploring new ideas and industries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provides opportunities to help others&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As always, this depends on the community you join. Not all experiences will be the same for all people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-the-community-that-supports-its-members&quot;&gt;Find the community that supports its members&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re looking to join a community, here are some signs that the community supports its members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authentic and vulnerable relationships and interactions,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investment in helping each other to grow -&amp;gt; look at how people are answering questions or if help and support posts are mostly answered,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Openness to new ideas and experiences -&amp;gt; are members testing out new ideas or actions? Do you see people saying they’ve done something for the first time as part of that group?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supportive communities can provide a space for you to try new things. For example, maybe you’re interested in speaking at a conference, but you’re afraid. If you have a supportive community, it’s easier to try out the experience. Give your presentation to the community and ask for feedback. When you have a supportive community, it’s easier to be open to feedback, to learn from the experience, and to work towards your goal of giving a presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-find-the-right-communities&quot;&gt;How to find the right communities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure they have a code of conduct, esp if you’re part of an under-represented group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They all you to be a passive member of a community -&amp;gt; soak up the knowledge and experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;signs-of-a-positive-community&quot;&gt;Signs of a positive community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a Code of Conduct&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For non-discord platforms, when people use their real names&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Members of under-represented groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;remote-work&quot;&gt;Remote Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some companies did even better when they were forced to go remote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can do the same thing from home that you can do in the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PPl are forming networks and relationships outside of the office as a result. There’s less glue, holding you to stick in the current position.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t have the opportunities to network outside of the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remote and COVID-remote are two very different things. There are a lot of extra outside stressors. Remote was being thrust on ppl rather than a decision people made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-work-in-a-physical-office&quot;&gt;Why work in a physical office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some people prefer to work in the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extrovert!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear physical lines of communication: You can walk to the person’s office if you have a question.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes a challenge of getting work done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a different type of productivity -&amp;gt; talking with the people around you allows you to develop relationships more quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You build teams much quicker in the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community building is easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;positives-of-working-remotely&quot;&gt;Positives of working remotely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexibility, especially for parents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows parents to take breaks and spend time with their kids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t have to commute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows for productive breaks -&amp;gt; You can start the laundry, dinner, do errands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigating-challenges-of-working-remotely&quot;&gt;Navigating challenges of working remotely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t have a designated office space, it can be a challenge, but if you set boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set rules for yourself: when to log off. Turn off the computer and don’t touch it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do a full shutdown every night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Separate work and “home” computer, so there’s no drive to work after work hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set a hard limit for work hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dealing with stress and the easy access to food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normalize kid noises in the back of every meeting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Productivity: there’s kind of no middle ground. There’s ppl who are super productive and not productive at all. This might speak to the type of office-environment that works best for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We shouldn’t be micromanaging. Daily standup, project tracking, and milestones are enough to evaluated the productivity of the team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forcing extra steps to force ppl to report progress, that’s toxic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there’s an issue with a person, approach it as “How can we support you? Is there a challenge I can help you with?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers should have autonomy and support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over-communication &amp;gt; under-communication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t do remote work on vacation!!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team-building remotely: Depending on the team, turn on the cameras, hear the voice of the other person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whole set of problems returning to office spaces now with mice, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus&quot;&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;blog post idea: how to structure your team to be productive&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Code + Community: the highlight reel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we wrapped up our second season of the Virtual Coffee (VC) Podcast with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/0209-season-two-wrapup/&quot;&gt;Code and Community episode&lt;/a&gt;. As VC’s been growing over the last year, I’ve been working on the Virtual Coffee model for communities, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danieltott&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; and I have spent a lot of time talking through navigating the challenges and creating a direction for our unique community with the support and care of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was especially inspired to write a highlight version of the episode when I saw Lucia’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BekahHW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@BekahHW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danieltott?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@danieltott&lt;/a&gt; are leaders in effective, unconventional ways. Listen for their view on metrics, community building, and purpose. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4FyYJhafO7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4FyYJhafO7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lucia Cerchie 🦎 (@CerchieLucia) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CerchieLucia/status/1400135495984709632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my top takeaways from this episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have so many ideas for the community, but there aren’t enough hours in the day to work on them all. We’re doing our best to prioritize them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re more than a slack of people who do meetups, events, and more. We’re “an intimate community for all devs, optimized for you.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The face-to-face conversations are a key part of our identity. And it’s important to us that we keep our breakout rooms small to allow opportunities for everyone to join in the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s easier to stretch and grow when you know you have the support of the community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re inspired by the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.radicalcandor.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radical Candor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! Clear and honest communication are important tools for trust and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We think of Virtual Coffee as an open source community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building deliberately and creating structures and processes to empower members to help takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re never going to put content behind a paywall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tooling with a team can be really expensive, and it’s challenging to find services that allow people to help when you have a small community and no funding .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The goal of the Virtual Coffee Model is to have a lasting impact on your community, to create ripples that extend far beyond your community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So much of community tooling is based on making money off our your members. Since that’s not our goal, it’s been challenging to find a good fit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As community leadership, you can see each person individually and you can recognize them, but if you don’t have support in the tools, in the structures, you’re not going to get very far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traditional community metrics leave a lot of people out. We value each member participating in the ways that are most comfortable for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our focus isn’t to grow &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, it’s to support our members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>I did something that scared me: I took a week off</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend recently asked me if I am a results or a process person. I told her that I’m a momentum person. I like to move. I don’t like breaks. But when we hit the one year mark of &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, and I realized that I hadn’t had a week off in a year I didn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to take time off, but I thought I probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. And it was the right call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-had-time-to-work-on-things-i-missed&quot;&gt;I had time to work on things I missed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem of being momentum-driven is that you go with the flow and the things that excite you. And when you have a community of a couple hundred people, there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of cool ideas. And I’ve been full force on the Virtual Coffee train for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking time off created time for me to revisit some of the things I love doing. I coded more. I worked on my postpartum wellness app. I spent less time on my phone. I spent time thinking about what I want and where I want to be. I created a new system for tasks and project for myself (it’s colored post-it notes that I stick on my wall, but it’s been great for brainstorming and prioritizing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to do a personal training session for the first time in a very long time. I worked on three different kinds of box jumps, because when you’re as short as I am, you’ve gotta make up for that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had fun. I had energizing conversations. I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-had-the-opportunity-to-do-some-tough-self-evaluation&quot;&gt;I had the opportunity to do some tough self-evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday at 9:00am EDT–when I usually host Virtual Coffee–I worked with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://katiecmckenna.com/&quot;&gt;favorite career coach&lt;/a&gt;, who helped me to breakdown tasks, prioritize, and to think strategically and practically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just finished meeting with the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katiecmckenna?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@katiecmckenna&lt;/a&gt; and it’s always a great use of my time. She asks the hard questions, says the things that are hard to hear, and helps me to believe in myself. (Also, she’s hilarious, kind, and a great author.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TfQDUVAggz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/TfQDUVAggz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bekah Hawrot Weigel (@BekahHW) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BekahHW/status/1384513366190866436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She made me break down the hours I spend on work and Virtual Coffee, and helped me realize some hard truths about some bad habits I was forming. She helped me find action items and made plans to hold me accountable. (If she asks, yes I am working on them!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at how I’ve been doing things from an objective level, from the perspective of “what advice would you give someone else who told you this is what they’ve been doing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that burnout happens in different ways and with different feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about the importance of boundaries and clearly setting them up. Because I’ve continually said that I have boundaries, but they’re easy to blur when you don’t have a clear guide to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I probably wasn’t doing a good job of providing an example for the Virtual Coffee members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I need to believe in myself, to acknowledge my strengths rather than devaluing them, and to recognize that what I’m doing–both as a developer and a community builder–is good and worthwhile work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-can-come-back-with-renewed-energy&quot;&gt;I can come back with renewed energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would be anxious the whole week. It was like leaving my kids for a weekend with my parents the first time. I was sad the first day, but then I inhaled deeply and felt renewed and refreshed and ready to jump back in after the break was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed it without knowing that I needed it. As an introvert, I’ve not done a great job of recognizing how impacted I’ve been by constantly being engaged. I’ve somehow developed the ability to get through the week, and then I hit the weekend and feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. I didn’t feel that this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of my “action items” from this break is to take a week off every quarter. Because I know it’s good for me, and it’s good for the community too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-could-see-the-virtual-coffee-pain-points-more-clearly&quot;&gt;I could see the Virtual Coffee pain points more clearly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating space between myself and the community also allowed me to not be caught up in all the day-to-day organizing and responding and allowed me to see things from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could walk through things without having to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the things. And I could much better identify where the chaos happens, where processes can be improved, where things are working well, where the community has really done a great job of innovating and responding to the groups needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-im-at-now&quot;&gt;Where I’m at now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m three days into my first week back at Virtual Coffee, and I’m proud of myself for working on ways to set boundaries, to not let myself fall back into old habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happy to see my friends. And that’s part of what makes this so hard. This community, these people, they’re my people. They’re the people I enjoy being around. They’re the people I want to share my wins and losses with. And maybe that’s how all community creators feel, or maybe that’s what happens when you accidentally start a community. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do know that providing the best support for the community means that I’ll need to take more time off, and that I need to prioritize creating clearer paths of communication and support. And it probably means that I need to tell myself that I can do this. Even though I’m afraid that I’m not the best person to be doing this, I can do it, and I can learn, and I can grow into the person I want to while doing this, with the support of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coding is Pattern-Matching: a growth-mindset perspective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I was talking to a woman who was doing simultaneous Masters degrees from Carnegie Mellon University and running a brain study on chronic depression. When we were talking about her multiple degrees and her musical experience, all while she let me pick her brain about neurology, she said something that stuck with me, “All life is pattern-matching.” She explained the connections between her mathematical and scientific experience with her creative endeavors, and it made sense. Patterns are everywhere, and we learn through recognizing and seeing the patterns, internalizing them, applying them, and eventually understanding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the approach I try to turn to when I’m frustrated with myself when I don’t “understand” the code that I’m seeing on the page. And &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is a perspective that I would’ve benefitted from when I was learning to code, but most recently now, it’s what I lean into when I’m frustrated with myself for not understanding new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-why-is-a-pattern-matching-perspective-important-to-coding&quot;&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is a pattern-matching perspective important to coding?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’ve let out some desperate cries to the universe to &lt;em&gt;please just let me get this so I can move on!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then one night, the magical neural-pathway fairy comes and sprinkles its coding dust onto my brain and I wake up, and suddenly it’s clicked. And I can’t remember why I couldn’t get it the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the perspective that coding is pattern-matching removes (at least some of) that frustration, tames those desperate cries to the universe, and empowers my progress rather than prohibits it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-does-pattern-matching-for-coding-even-mean&quot;&gt;But &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; does pattern-matching for coding even mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you get hung up on “understanding” all of the concepts. And, of course, that’s important. But you shouldn’t be stuck on learning the same thing over and over in the attempt to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; understand something. That will come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pattern-matching perspective: Looking at the patterns in code and being able to replicate those patterns in other projects. You don’t have to know why the pieces work, just that they are the pieces, and how they match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s look at a JavaScript Object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const person = {name: 'Leslie', job:'Parks and Recreation Deputy Director', favoriteFood:'waffles'}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe we need to create another person object. We don’t need to know why there are curly braces here or why there are colons. We don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know that there are keys and values. We need to recognize the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to recognize is that there are general attribute indicators (name, job, favoriteFood), that are followed by colons and then specific information, wrapped in quotes. And all of this is wrapped in curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re just breaking down the pieces so we can apply this in our own situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is that the more I apply the code that I’ve learned in practical ways (real world projects), the more I’m able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone would’ve told me that I needed to totally understand all of JavaScript before moving on to React, I would still be learning JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t be waiting to fully understand. Tech changes so quickly that full mastery likely won’t ever happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m moving into new projects, I’m taking this mindset with me. I’m looking for patterns and applying them. The next step is recognizing what we need in our coding projects by seeing the patterns in the code. And maybe that sparks an Aha! moment, like I could really use a useEffect here. Or using grid seems like a practical choice here. (But that Aha! moment deserves its own blog post.) And finally, those patterns click in our brains and we start to understand the hows and whys and whats of coding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Year of Community: The Three Ls of an Accidental Community Creator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Anyone interested in talking job search over virtual coffee tomorrow morning?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bekah Hawrot Weigel (@BekahHW) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BekahHW/status/1245829083025428481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a year later, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We’re here with a community I couldn’t have dreamt up. We’re here talking about the future. Thinking about the next time we do a Hacktoberfest event, the third time we run &lt;a href=&quot;youtube.com/watch?v=UQl8q09BpiA&amp;amp;list=PLh9uT23TA65infGqUUaVibI0IssI0G6NY&quot;&gt;lightning talks&lt;/a&gt;, about the next set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/&quot;&gt;podcast episodes&lt;/a&gt; we record, about the amazing things our members are doing, about collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Coffee is a lot of different things, to a lot of different people, but, as it says on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/about/&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Virtual Coffee is, and always will be, a genuine community of people who value and prioritize supporting one another. We know that growth comes at all levels and that no matter what stage of the developer journey you’re on, you can teach and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lived through a lot of growth in the last year, because accidentally starting a community during a pandemic can force that on you. I learned a lot about myself, and a lot about community, and I’m sharing this because a lot of that time was incredibly fulfilling and a lot of that time was lonely; and I’ve had a hard time finding people who are talking about the three Ls: learning, loneliness, and loveliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning&quot;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-ive-learned&quot;&gt;What I’ve learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that sometimes it is a joy to give and share with people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That trusting the people you’re collaborating with is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That you should be able to argue and disagree with the people you trust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That I am energized by other people’s energy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sometimes things will work out like you anticipate and other times they most definitely do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That a supported community will form their own subcommunities within your group and be amazing while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sometimes the members you think are confident are silently struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sometimes you have to trust your gut feeling. You know it’s not right, but you can’t explain why. And for me, most times my gut has been right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That the best education you can get will happen when you reach out and ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am either intensely shy or I go for it. Usually, the go-for-it-Bekah comes when I find value in what I’m doing; when I’m working with other people. But it especially comes when I see other people’s needs that aren’t being met. And if “cold DMing” other founders, devs, community managers can help me support my community, my friends, then I do it without thinking or worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That so many people will tell you that what you’re doing isn’t possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tangent time: In 7th grade I ran track. I wanted to run the hurdles. I could clear them fine with no training, and had the second fastest time on my team. When I asked the coach if I could run them, he told me no. “You’re too short.” That’s the moment in my life where I realized that when people told me I couldn’t, it became an instant challenge. I can be an early career developer. I can create community. I can find a way to keep us intimate and small and grow at the same time. I can do the things that I never thought I could. Four years ago, I never would’ve expected that I would be this person. I never would’ve guessed I’d even be a developer. I don’t believe in the impossible. I embrace it as a challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-im-still-learning&quot;&gt;What I’m Still Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That a &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt; can be a no to a hundred other things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sometimes honesty hurts, but the people around you deserve honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That I don’t need to be an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That asking for help is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sometimes your gut feeling will be wrong, and that’s ok. You learn from that experience and take it with you to the next. Sometimes it’s messy. Sometimes it puts you behind where you expect to be, but it puts you ahead for the next time it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;loneliness&quot;&gt;loneliness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-getting-through-the-hard-times&quot;&gt;On Getting Through the Hard Times&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you accidentally start a community, you accidentally become the leader, and then you give your time and sometimes your money to make sure the community keeps going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And suddenly you find that you’ve been giving every ounce of yourself, and you’re tired. And you want to scream out for help, but it’s hard. You don’t want to let anyone down. You don’t want anyone to know that you’ve thought that other people would do a better job and that you should hand it over to those other people and walk away for the betterment of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at some point, you start to feel like you’re not part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not supported, this leads straight to burnout. (And super shoutout to Dan and Kirk, who have brought me back more than once from that point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a lonely space to feel like you have no one to talk to. To feel like the decisions you’ve made were not the right ones, and you don’t know how to recover from that. To hear from people you respect, that you can’t do what you’re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing, I hit a breaking point–well, probably a couple of times. But what allowed me to push through those times was knowing who supported me. And, for me, that happened when I was silently struggling, and my friends could read it on my face and came to help. I’m working at getting better at verbalizing this. But their support saved me, saved the community, and made beautiful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve hit &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of personal life challenges in the last year. But I’ve known who I should message first in those situations, who had my back, who would carry me when I was down, who would support the community. And that’s psychological safety, but it’s also friendship. And knowing that &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; are there for the community is so important to me in those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;loveliness&quot;&gt;loveliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been good with friendships. I’m shy. I’m an introvert–or maybe an ambivert, but that’s tbd. My ADHD dx in the last year has played a huge role in understanding this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never felt so at home with a group of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing their kindness, their excitement, their growth. Seeing their willingness to help each other and to be helped. To share and be vulnerable. To cheer each other on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s special. There’s authenticity. No bravado. And I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a DM or been a part of a thread, that’s given me what I needed to get me through a hard time. Or when members have shown up, because they are my friends–most of whom I have yet to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. Do your community leaders care about the community? Because it’s easy to spot many of the people who are &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; the role. Authenticity matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week three things happened that further solidified that this is one of my favorite places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was a thread in the #neurodiverse channel. What started out as an ADHD discussion, went into a true and beautiful ADHD thread that was clever, random, and hilarious, and brought the energy I love about my neurodiversity and the community I’ve found through Virtual Coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was when I realized that I’ve been doing Virtual Coffee for a year straight, and haven’t had a week off for a year. I messaged Dan–who is an Organization Maintainer with me–to ask if he thought it would be ok for me to take a week off. And I got nothing but support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking time off is not an easy thing for me to do, but when we interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomcudd&quot;&gt;Tom Cudd&lt;/a&gt; for the Virtual Coffee podcast, he talked about how he set the example for his team with his work habits. And it was validation. Because I’ll tell members to practice self-care and to refuse to work more than 40 hours a week, but the truth is, I’m bad at setting that boundary for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Coffee isn’t a job, and I haven’t made any money doing it, but I spend a lot of my time developing the community, meeting with people who can help me understand how to support our members, developing events and processes and docs and topics that encourage growth and mentorship at all stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I’m going to do it. I’m going to take a week off this month. And it will be hard, but I’ve already got ideas for what I’m going to do. (One will involve heavy weights.) But honestly, it’s important. I love this community with my whole heart, and they’ve seen my tears more than a handful of times because I give them the fullness of myself. But I also need to allow myself a time to focus on my personal growth as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could spend hours talking about what I’ve learned in the last year, but I am very thankful that I’ve done it with Virtual Coffee. I am thankful for the DMs I get encouraging me. I am thankful for the kindness that everyone shares. I am thankful for the support of my fellow maintainers. I am thankful for the community members who support each other. I am thankful for those around me who realize that I’m struggling, but I don’t know how to verbalize it. And I am thankful for the subtle moments of acceptance. Because those have been the ones that’ve powered me through this intensely challenging year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons I've Learned from 100 Virtual Coffees</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s almost been a year since Virtual Coffee was born from my cry of desperation into the Twittersphere. From knowing that I couldn’t let myself be isolated during the time the world was calling for isolation. I knew from my experience with trauma four years ago that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; needed community to get me through this, even though I’m shy and an introvert and that reaching out into the Twitter void and opening myself up at this most vulnerable moment was terrifying. And now on this 100th Coffee, I’m going to talk about what I’ve learned just from those zoom sessions–I’ll save the rest of the things I’ve learned for the one-year Virtual Coffee post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What those coffees started as were a place to talk during social isolation, a place to make friends, a place to laugh and to cry and to watch my 3 year old daughter pour all the leave-in conditioner she could find into my hair. It started as a place to be fully myself because the stress of looking for work during the pandemic, of having the kids home and doing school, of not knowing what tomorrow’s interview would bring was enough that I didn’t even have the emotional energy to spend trying to only show the parts of myself I thought were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it became was a beautiful community of people who I missed when they weren’t there, an event that people were putting in newsletters, a place where you are welcomed to participate in the ways that make you feel comfortable. A place where every person is met and welcomed as a person before anything else–developer, student, founder. A place where every person can be a mentor, a student, a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is (a non-exhaustive) list of what I’ve learned from those Coffees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caring about other people, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; knowing and caring about them, can make a huge impact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes you won’t know what to say. That’s ok.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apologize when you need to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People you’ve never met in real life can be your closest friends.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like we say at the beginning of every coffee, “An awkward pause for one person, can be an opportunity for another person to join in.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes differences in opinions and life experiences can be really hard to navigate, but if you put in the time and effort, they can lead to some of the most important moments of growth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One person’s support can make all the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is ok to ask questions, to ask for clarification, to disagree.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes you’ll disappoint people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes people will disappoint you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes people won’t like you or won’t think you’re good enough, and it will hurt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes remembering the little things are the most meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone is motivated in different ways. Knowing them, understanding where they’re at in life, can go a long way in being a supportive friend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kindness matters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes honesty hurts, even when it’s offered with kindness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Willingness to listen and openness to different opinions is important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a supportive community is one of the most important things for growth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes you’re the only one who shows up for that person on your screen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Psychological safety is incredibly important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bidets are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; for snorkeling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes we underestimate people who are different than us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability invites vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is never a time when I don’t learn from someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes people just need a chance. Sometimes you have to be willing to offer that chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much I’ve learned from these Tuesday/Thursday zoom coffees. Having the opportunity to see and hear from people all over the world, with all different experience levels has been an irreplaceable experience. When you’re in a place where you feel supported and safe, you’re ability to grow–in expected and unexpected ways–is unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Out of My Comfort Zone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; my comfort zone. A lot. It’s a familiar space. It’s a warm blanket, a cup of coffee, in front of a fire. It’s the crack of the bat against a baseball on a hot July day. It’s hearing that song from when I was eleven and still knowing all the words. I think comfort zones are good, but pushing ourselves out of them, pushing ourselves into unknown territories, those are the places we grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last twelve months have been a lot of growing, and I didn’t even have to push myself to do it. The world did it for me. But there are times when I felt like I had been comfortable for too long, and I needed to push myself to do those things that scared me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that thing was asking for help instead of going deeper down the rabbit hole by myself. Sometimes it was accepting someone’s offer to help. Sometimes it was jumping into a new adventure without all the planning and discussions I would have done if I wanted to make sure the moment was just right. Taking my first dev job, almost two years ago, was pushing myself way out of my comfort zone. Sometimes it’s sharing these moments with others. Some of these things I talk about on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/0109-bekah-dan/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is one of the things that I did to force myself out of my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently decided I was going to livestream talking through and working on my postpartum wellness app, which was absolutely terrifying. But I was inspired by Drew Clements talking about how he livestreams working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://protege.dev/&quot;&gt;Protege.dev&lt;/a&gt; as an accountability tool. It’s not enough that I’m still very much new to React Native. I wanted to add to that the accountability that comes with livestreaming.I’ve only done it a couple of times, but I learned that it’s not about having all of the answers; it’s about communicating when you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s ok to have questions. It’s ok to look things up. It’s ok to forget how to do something you’ve done 100x before. It happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about not getting frustrated when you don’t have those things. It’s about learning how to move forward, how to grow. And it’s remembering that process the next time you have that feeling of not being good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many times that I’m mad at myself for not knowing more or for feeling like I should be better at coding than I am. That I should have more done than I do. And that’s not productive; negative self talk does not help me grow. (I’m going to say it again, for the people who need to hear it; also, me. I need to hear it again.) Negative self talk does not help me grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting out of your comfort zone and growing is hard. And sometimes it means hearing things that are hard to hear. Sometimes, it’s having those hard conversations when you want to ignore the problem and hope it disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend said to me the other day, “Bekah, there’s a reason they’re called growing pains. It doesn’t feel good.” I think it’s about embracing that pain by getting out of your comfort zone, but not being &lt;em&gt;stuck&lt;/em&gt; in the place you were last time, last week, last tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t solve problems by ignoring them. You tackle the error in your console one piece at a time. And sometimes it’s minutes and sometimes it’s days, but damn it feels good when you finally have that project up on the screen. And that’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Complicated Anniversaries: It's Ok to Not Be Ok</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Life has been &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; lately. It’s been complicated, and I’ve had a hard time understanding why. And then I read this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We're coming up on a year of being in this pandemic, there's some sort of weird existential dread hitting a lot of us.

The bad news: we're all in this at the same time, together. The good news: we're all in this at the same time, together.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sarah Drasner (@sarah_edo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1360023399104274433&quot;&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was it. That was the moment where I thought “oh, I know how this goes.” I know about trauma anniversaries. I know what they do to me. I know how I struggle through thinking through things. I know how I’m anxious. I know how I’m irritable. I know how my mind races at night, how I wake up at 2am and can’t go back to sleep, I know how I feel like a wrecking ball of emotions because I’m freaking doing the best I can do and I feel like I’m letting every single person down because the world is fucking overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this feeling  well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have desperately tried to get away from it for the last four and a half years. And, “hello, trauma, we meet again. And you’re compounding yourself on top of what I’m already going through. And this time, fuck you, because you’re stacking yourself on top of my kids too. And I could barely hold on when it was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; me. But now you’re trying to take them down too. And I will not stand for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Last time, it was almost all of me. I couldn’t see my life past trauma, until one person, just one, reached out and said, I’ve been through this. It was different, but also the same. And I heard the words that I thought in my head. And I understood the self-dount, and I heard the voices of every single person who doubted me in my life and I said “Fuck you.” But this time, it’s not just me. It’s me, it’s my kids and my family, it’s my friends–who I love deeply–it’s the community that has held tight to each other. And it’s hard. I am trying so very hard to be the one who can hold everyone up. And I know that we all hold each other up, but it’s hard. It’s a trustfall, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the thing: we fail at a trustfall if we’re not honest with ourselves. It’s ok to not be ok. It’s ok to say that. It’s a good thing to reach out for support. We’re all very much going through this together–and some of us are dealing with extra things on top of it–and if anything, we learn about the importance of honesty, of commmunication, of empathy. And we all come out the other end as a stronger community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, can we be ok struggling together? Can we be ok having off weeks together? Because this is all normal–a normal trauma response–and let’s acknowledge that for many of us, that’s what the entire last year has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s ok for the last year to have some amazing and bright spots. It’s ok for the last year to feel empty. But now, more than ever, I want you to know that I am here for you. I am here if we have never spoken, I am here if we’ve had a million conversations but haven’t felt close, I am here for you wherever you are in your life if you feel this way. Because I will never leave anyone in isolation. I’m here. And it doesn’t matter what role you’ve had in my life. I am just here for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Hot Takes for the New Year</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time stuck in my head, wondering if what I say is going to hurt someone or lead them on the wrong path, or flat-out be wrong. And that’s exhausting. I love going on podcasts, but the after-effect is that I rethink my every statement to see if it could possibly hurt someone. And there have been times that I’ve asked podcasts to cut something. But the truth is, we all live our own story. And sometimes we say things wrong, but we give the right advice. And sometimes our advice is meaningful for a bunch of people, but not one. And sometimes our stories impact one person and that’s it. But I’m here for that one person. Because if you have ever felt alone, like you are the only one who understands your experience, that &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; experience that you can relate to, can make the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this post isn’t going to give all the details, because I have spent my detail energy for the week, but it will give you my hot takes, that I want to reserve energy for in upcoming posts, if you want it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let people know when they provide you with valuable information
I cannot tell you how many times I have considered stopping whatever I was doing, but then I got one message that affirmed what I did or said, and that was enough. Over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, we’re planning our second round of Lightning Talks. Last round, I strong-armed my way through a lot of the event organizing alone. This time, I’m working to create processes and engage and empower members to create this event. In our meeting on Monday, I was honest with them: Last time I was so exhausted that I wanted to sleep for a month. And then I started seeing how much our members appreciated it, how proud our speakers were. And then I said, “how soon can we do this again.” And someone responded, “The post-conference high.” And that’s very much the feeling I get when one person tells me about how my sharing has impacted their lives. So if someone has written, spoken, tweeted, whatever, in a way that has motivated you, &lt;em&gt;tell them&lt;/em&gt;, because that will motivate them too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re never going to be ready, so start.
I have four kids, and I always laugh when people tell me they aren’t ready to have kids. I wasn’t ready for any of this. In fact, I never had dreams or goals of being married or being a mom. Fun fact, I was 21 when I got married, and 24 when I had my first kid. I’m not going to apologize for telling my story. I’m not telling &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; this is your story. But this is one of the times that I pushed past fear and made meaning in my life. And it was hard. A lot. But, I most certainly grew leaps and bounds. When I started my blog, I didn’t even know that dev tools were a thing. And if you go back far enough in my code, you can see that I didn’t know that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have the hard conversations.
Hard conversations are…hard. But they are worth it. If you can come out the other end of very difficult conversations, if you can disagree with someone and find a meeting point, if you can approach them with empathy, honestly, and leave with clarity, then you can do so much. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; you’ll know the people you can do it with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to people in your network.
The worst thing you can get is a no or no response. I feel like I have had a masters class in entrepreneurship in the last couple of months because I have &lt;em&gt;asked&lt;/em&gt; founders, owners, consultants, to talk to me about my use-case. And nearly all of them have said yes and been amazing. Early-2020 Bekah wouldn’t have done that. And I can’t explain exactly what happened, except I allowed myself to think of myself as a capable person who was willing to stake a small embarrassment for the opportunity of learning from the people I value most in the tech community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are not defined by others, and along with that good communities will help you when you feel alone.
There have been a number of times where I’ve felt &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; as a promotional story. I would help &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to elevate themselves because they helped &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, a mom of 4 kids, a career-changer, a trauma-survivor. And then when I reached out to them, when I asked for support, there was nothing. And it hurt. A lot. But here’s the thing: I am a mother of four. I am a career-changer. I am a trauma-survivor. And I have a community of people who love and support me. And if you are reading this and you feel like you have no one, I can 100% guarantee that &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt; has a place for you. We are here to meet every person where they are. To support, and to guide, to mentor and provide for. And I know my community, and I know that they will be your people if you let us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
