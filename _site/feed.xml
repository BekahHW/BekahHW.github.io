        <title>The Invisible Load: How AI Workflows Can Replace Your Team's 'Glue Person'</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every team has one, and, tbh, a lot of relationships have one. The person who remembers. For teams, it might be the person who remembers to update the changelog. Who posts the weekly standup summary. Who follows up on that GitHub issue from three weeks ago. Who makes sure the docs match the latest release. Who bridges the gap between what engineering ships and what the rest of the company knows about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this “glue work,” and research shows it disproportionately falls on women in teams, and mothers in relationships. It’s the invisible labor that keeps everything running smoothly, but rarely shows up in performance reviews or promotion discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that glue work is essential, but it shouldn’t be someone’s primary job. And it definitely shouldn’t be the reason talented people get passed over for advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if AI workflows could be the glue instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-glue-work-problem&quot;&gt;The Glue Work Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanya Reilly’s essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noidea.dog/glue/&quot;&gt;“Being Glue”&lt;/a&gt; describes how critical but undervalued work like coordinating between teams, translating technical concepts, maintaining documentation, ensuring follow-through often becomes invisible. The people who do it often make everything seem easy. But there’s a cost, and it’s compounding in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have one teammate who’s spending hours each week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating tickets after standups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posting release summaries to Slack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making sure customer support knows about new features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chasing down PR reviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating documentation after merges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following up on blocked issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when none of this is their actual job, then they may be your “glue.” All of it is necessary. But when they stop doing it, things fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it doesn’t seem that bad right now, but coordination work compounds as teams grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-workflows-could-be-the-glue&quot;&gt;What If Workflows Could Be the Glue?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where composed AI workflows change everything. Not because they eliminate coordination work, but because they automate it at the seams between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/individual-workflows-scale-linearly-composed-compound-chad-metcalf-x7fyc&quot;&gt;composed workflows&lt;/a&gt;, Continue CEO Chad Metcalf makes an important distinction: a single workflow saves time, but composed workflows compound. When the output of one workflow can trigger the next, you’re doing more than just automating individual tasks. You’re automating the entire coordination system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at what this actually means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-1-the-release-communication-burden&quot;&gt;Example 1: The Release Communication Burden&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current state:&lt;/strong&gt; After every release, someone (usually the same someone) needs to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draft changelog entries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update product documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post to company Slack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update customer-facing docs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create support team briefing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Close related Linear issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That “someone” spends 2-3 hours per release on coordination work. Not working on more impactful work. Just making sure everyone knows what shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With composed workflows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Merge to main 
  → Extract changes from PR descriptions 
  → Draft changelog entry 
  → Update technical docs 
  → Generate customer-facing summary 
  → Post to internal Slack 
  → Update support knowledge base 
  → Close related issues
  → Post completion summary
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire coordination chain runs automatically. The output of one workflow triggers the next. No one spends their afternoon being glue. Instead, they become the human in the loop who reviews and improves the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-2-the-follow-up-tax&quot;&gt;Example 2: The Follow-Up Tax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current state:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re in standup. Someone mentions they’re blocked on a security review. Everyone nods. The meeting ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days later, nothing’s happened because nobody remembered to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a ticket&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tag the security team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow up when there’s no response&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the original ticket&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the blocked person know it’s unblocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess who remembers? The glue person, who now spends their time tracking other people’s blockers instead of writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With composed workflows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Blocked on X&quot; detected in standup notes 
  → Create Linear issue with context 
  → Tag relevant team 
  → Set reminder for 2 days 
  → Follow up if no response 
  → Update original ticket when resolved 
  → Notify blocked person
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The follow-through happens automatically. Nobody has to be the memory keeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-3-the-support-handoff&quot;&gt;Example 3: The Support Handoff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current state:&lt;/strong&gt; Customer reports a bug in Slack. Engineering fixes it. But somehow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support never gets notified the fix is live&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer still thinks it’s broken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docs don’t reflect the fix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The original Slack thread is forgotten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone (the glue person) ends up manually connecting all these dots. Every. Single. Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With composed workflows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bug report in Slack 
  → Create Linear issue 
  → PR created and merged 
  → Update documentation 
  → Generate fix summary 
  → Post to support channel 
  → Reply to original Slack thread 
  → Close Linear issue with summary
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire loop closes itself. From report to fix to notification to documentation to closure. No human glue required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-works-where-other-solutions-dont&quot;&gt;Why This Works Where Other Solutions Don’t&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-not-about-replacing-people&quot;&gt;It’s Not About Replacing People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI workflows aren’t replacing the glue person’s judgment or expertise. They’re replacing the repetitive coordination tasks that shouldn’t require judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a PR merges, updating the changelog doesn’t need human insight. Following up on a blocked issue after two days doesn’t require strategic thinking. Posting a deployment summary to Slack isn’t creative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are mechanical transitions between tasks. Perfect candidates for automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-compounds-over-time&quot;&gt;It Compounds Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what makes this different from other automation attempts: composition creates compounding value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each workflow you add doesn’t just save time on that specific task. It amplifies the value of workflows already running. The deployment workflow outputs information the changelog workflow needs. The Linear sync workflow triggers the documentation update workflow. The customer support workflow feeds the product insights workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not just automating individual tasks. You’re automating the entire coordination system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-preserves-the-actual-value-of-glue&quot;&gt;It Preserves the Actual Value of “Glue”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The valuable part of glue work isn’t the mechanical coordination. It’s the strategic connection-making, the pattern recognition, the ability to see across teams and translate context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When AI workflows handle the mechanical parts, the humans who were doing glue work can focus on the strategic parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can spend time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifying patterns across customer feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving team processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mentoring junior developers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solving actually complex problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advancing their technical skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that actually deserve their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-composition-advantage&quot;&gt;The Composition Advantage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual workflows are helpful. Composed workflows are transformative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Chad Metcalf writes in his post on composed workflows: “Individual workflows give linear improvements. Composed workflows compound.” This distinction is crucial when thinking about how to replace organizational glue work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because here’s what happens when workflows compose: the coordination work stops being a burden on any individual. Instead, it becomes part of the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not asking someone to remember to update the docs after deployment. The deployment workflow triggers the documentation workflow automatically. You’re not relying on someone to follow up on blocked issues. The standup workflow creates follow-up workflows with built-in reminders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is infrastructure that scales with your team. As you grow, the glue work compounds. But with composed workflows, the automation compounds instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-team-impact-beyond-time-savings&quot;&gt;Real Team Impact: Beyond Time Savings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about what this actually means for teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-more-that-person&quot;&gt;No More “That Person”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coordination work is automated, it stops being concentrated on one or two people. The person who used to spend 10 hours a week on glue work can spend those hours on actual engineering. Or product work. Or whatever they were actually hired to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly: they stop being the bottleneck. When knowledge and coordination flows through automated systems rather than through specific people, teams become more resilient. People can take vacation without everything falling apart. New team members can onboard without needing to know who to ask for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;career-equity&quot;&gt;Career Equity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glue work is often invisible during performance reviews. “Sarah keeps everything running smoothly” doesn’t translate to promotion decisions the way “shipped three major features” does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When AI workflows handle coordination, engineers can focus on work that’s more visible and valued. This has disproportionate impact on people—often women and mothers—who tend to take on more glue work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team-velocity-at-scale&quot;&gt;Team Velocity at Scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small teams can coordinate informally. “Hey, remember to update the docs” works when you’re five people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 20 people? 50? Informal coordination breaks down. You need systems. The question is: will those systems be human-dependent, automated, or composed with a human in the loop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composed workflows scale. Human coordination doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-actually-do-this&quot;&gt;How to Actually Do This&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t start by trying to automate everything. Start with the most repetitive, predictable coordination work on your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-identify-your-glue-work&quot;&gt;Step 1: Identify Your Glue Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have an honest conversation. Ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What coordination tasks happen after every release?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What follow-ups consistently fall through the cracks?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where does information get stuck between teams?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who’s spending time on mechanical updates vs. strategic work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write it down. You’re looking for patterns, not one-off tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-build-one-workflow&quot;&gt;Step 2: Build One Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick the most painful coordination task. The one that happens constantly and requires zero judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changelog updates after merges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standup note distribution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PR review reminders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linear ticket status syncing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation updates post-deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a workflow that handles it end-to-end. Run it for a week. Measure intervention rate—how often does it need human correction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get that intervention rate below 5%. Then move to step 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-compose&quot;&gt;Step 3: Compose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the output of your first workflow. What happens next in the coordination chain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your workflow posts deployment notes to Slack, what normally happens after that? Maybe documentation gets updated. Maybe customer support gets briefed. Maybe Linear tickets get closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build workflows for those next steps. Connect them to your first workflow’s output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have composition. One workflow’s completion triggers the next. The coordination chain runs automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-keep-going&quot;&gt;Step 4: Keep Going&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each new workflow amplifies the ones before it. The deployment workflow feeds the documentation workflow. The documentation workflow triggers the changelog workflow. The changelog workflow posts to Slack, which triggers the customer communication workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not just saving time on individual tasks. You’re building a system where coordination happens automatically at every transition point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bigger-picture&quot;&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about efficiency. It’s about equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When essential coordination work is visible and automated, nobody gets stuck being the invisible glue. Everyone can focus on the work they’re actually good at, the work that gets recognized and rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams that build composed AI workflows aren’t just shipping faster. They’re redistributing the coordination burden from people to systems. They’re making space for everyone to do their best work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at your team. Who’s the glue person? What would they be working on if they weren’t constantly coordinating?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the real value of composition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When We Became What We Do: The Identity Crisis That Companies Mistook for Opportunity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, a &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; thing happened to how we answered the question “Who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, most of us had multifaceted identities. I was the person who went to the gym and lifted weights 6x a week, who took my kids to the park all the time, who volunteered at the school, attended the occasional book club, and who took a break by going grocery shopping on Saturday mornings. For many of us, our sense of self was distributed across multiple domains, including social, familial, recreational, and professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-great-identity-consolidation&quot;&gt;The Great Identity Consolidation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lockdown stripped most of those identities away in a matter of weeks or even days. Even family gatherings and Sunday dinners and holiday traditions moved to Zoom calls or stopped entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every space where we’d embody our various identities closed. I couldn’t be “the person who deadlifted on Tuesdays” when there was no weightroom open. You can’t be “the parent who knows everyone at school” when school is a URL. You can’t be “the person who always hosts game night” when gathering is prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our professional identity didn’t just persist. It intensified, because work didn’t stop. In actuality, for a lot of us it intensified or became the one thing we could control. I lost my job, but I could look for another. For many people, work-from-home meant &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; hours. Slack channels kept pinging. Standups kept happening. Deadlines didn’t pause for a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, “developer” or “designer” or “product manager” wasn’t just what we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;. It became almost the entirety of who we &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not by choice. By elimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote work intensified what researchers called “identity blur” or the breakdown of boundaries between personal and professional life. Not to mention that an entire generation of early-career professionals were doing their identity formation almost exclusively through the professional lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-tech-communities-exploded&quot;&gt;Why Tech Communities Exploded&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This identity shift created fertile ground for professional communities to thrive in unprecedented ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer communities, in particular, saw explosive growth. The community infrastructure was already there: Slack, Discord, forums, virtual meetups. But suddenly, these weren’t just places to ask technical questions or network for jobs. They became primary social spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started Virtual Coffee in March of 2020, I was &lt;em&gt;desperately&lt;/em&gt; looking for &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; after I lost my first developer job. It wasn’t supplementing my social life because it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; my social life. The Tuesday meetups became my weekly social anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wasn’t alone. Across the tech ecosystem, professional communities became all-purpose gathering spaces. The hallway track at conferences had always been valuable, but now people were craving the hallway track without the conference. They wanted the coffee shop where everyone was a developer. They wanted to belong somewhere, and professional identity was one of the few identities still accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers-that-told-a-story&quot;&gt;The Numbers That Told a Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2021, the indicators were everywhere:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community engagement increased&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community programs saw increased recognition of their value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having an online community became more important in 2020&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time on social and community platforms jumped dramatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s what the numbers &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; saying: they weren’t showing that people had discovered a permanent need for professional community. They were showing that professional community was filling a vacuum left by every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; kind of community disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional community wasn’t competing with other professional communities. It was competing with—and replacing—gyms, coffee shops, happy hours, hobby groups, neighborhood connections, and casual friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-company-gold-rush&quot;&gt;The Company Gold Rush&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies looked at those engagement numbers and saw opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were a tech company in 2020-2021 watching developers flock to online communities, the conclusion seemed obvious: we need a community. If you were hiring and saw that developer engagement was at all-time highs, you might think: we need a community manager. I became a technical community manager because tech was primed to invest in community roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role that was previously a nice-to-have became a strategic imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies launched Slacks, Discord servers, forums, and user groups. They hired community managers, developer advocates, and DevRel teams. They built content strategies around community engagement. They measured success by the metrics they were seeing everywhere: member counts, daily active users, message volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic seemed on track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are engaging with online communities at unprecedented levels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our competitors are building communities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community drives product adoption and loyalty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, we need to invest in community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this logic missed &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-substitution-effect-nobody-acknowledged&quot;&gt;The Substitution Effect Nobody Acknowledged&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What companies were observing wasn’t a permanent shift in how people want to engage with brands or products. It was a temporary substitution driven by extraordinary circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020-2021, professional communities were standing in for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local social connections (because we couldn’t gather)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recreational identities (because hobbies were paused)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Casual professional networking (because conferences were canceled)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workspace camaraderie (because offices were closed)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General human connection (because isolation was mandatory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engagement wasn’t high because people suddenly valued brand communities more. It was high because professional community was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; community many people had access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: if you’re working from home, can’t go to the gym, can’t meet friends for coffee, and can’t attend local meetups, where do you find people? If your identity as a weight lifter is on hold because gyms are closed, and your identity as a parent is strained because you’re homeschooling, what’s left? Your professional identity. And where do professionals gather? Online, in communities organized around their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-success-really-looked-like&quot;&gt;What Success Really Looked Like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies celebrated metrics that looked like success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our Discord hit 10,000 members!”
“Daily active users up 300%!”
“Community engagement is our highest ever!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a lot of them were ignoring the fact that people weren’t necessarily there because your product was so compelling that they wanted to be part of your brand community. They were there because they were lonely, isolated, and craving connection, and your professional community was one of the only options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to diminish the genuine connections people made or the real value these communities provided. Virtual Coffee meant–and still means–the world to me. The developer communities that emerged during this time saved people’s mental health and careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; for that value was specific to the moment. We were all in crisis, and professional community became a lifeline not because it was uniquely better than before, but because everything else was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;belonging-doesnt-scale-the-way-companies-hoped&quot;&gt;Belonging Doesn’t Scale the Way Companies Hoped&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t manufacture the conditions that created pandemic-era engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t make someone lonely enough to spend three hours a day in your Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t make someone isolated enough to treat your Slack like their primary social group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t make someone identity-starved enough to build their sense of self around your brand community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you most definitely should not want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world reopened, people’s identities re-diversified. The parent identity came back with in-person school. The athlete identity returned with reopened gyms. The friend identity flourished with in-person coffee dates. The hobbyist identity resumed with craft groups and sports leagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional identity didn’t disappear, but it was &lt;em&gt;one of many&lt;/em&gt; identities, not the primary or only identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But companies didn’t anticipate: people wanted to keep both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connections made during the pandemic weren’t casual networking. They were trauma bonds. We didn’t just share technical knowledge in those slacks and Zoom rooms. We &lt;em&gt;survived&lt;/em&gt; isolation together, processed fear together, figured out how to keep going together. We saw each other at our worst: unmuted kids screaming, laundry piles stacked and thrown across the floor, tears with lost jobs. We celebrated new babies through screens. We mourned miscarriages together in the #heavy channel. We watched marriages fall apart in real-time as people processed isolation and stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we lost people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when that happened, we couldn’t gather. We couldn’t hug each other. We couldn’t sit together at a funeral. We watched memorial services on Zoom, crying alone in our homes, typing condolences in chat windows, wishing desperately we could just &lt;em&gt;be there&lt;/em&gt; together in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grief was compounded by the medium. These were people who’d kept us sane, who we’d talked to nearly every day, who felt like lifelines. And when they were gone, we had to process that loss the same way we’d built the relationship, through screens, at a distance, without the physical comfort that humans need in grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These weren’t casual professional connections. These were people who’d seen us completely, who’d held space for our fear and loneliness, who’d shared their own vulnerability in ways that rarely happen in professional contexts. The bonds formed under those conditions of shared trauma, radical vulnerability, mutual survival, don’t just dissolve when offices reopen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t like moving to a new city and losing touch with old friends, or kids graduating so you stop seeing other parents at pickup. Those transitions are natural drift. This was different. People wanted to maintain these deep connections while returning to physical community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But time is finite. You can’t spend three hours a day in the Virtual Coffee co-working room when you’re back at an actual office. You can’t attend every virtual event when you’re back at the gym, at your kid’s school, at in-person meetups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in engagement wasn’t people abandoning communities they didn’t care about. It was people being pulled between communities they cared about deeply and being forced to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people stayed in their pandemic communities because those bonds meant everything. Some drifted away despite wanting to stay connected. Many tried to maintain both and felt guilty about not being as present online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional identity didn’t disappear, but it returned to being one of many identities, not the primary or only identity. And with finite time and attention, something had to give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-misread-that-shaped-a-strategy&quot;&gt;The Misread That Shaped a Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies saw the engagement decline and treated it like a problem to solve rather than a natural consequence of changed circumstances.
The mistake wasn’t that companies built communities. Many of those communities genuinely serve people who need them, and many of those pandemic-era bonds are real and lasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mistake was thinking they could recreate or sustain trauma-bond-level engagement without the trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They thought the pandemic-era engagement levels were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sustainable (Actually, many required conditions no one should want to recreate)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Universal (Actually, many were born of collective crisis)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reproducible (Actually, many were trauma bonds form under specific circumstances)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transferable (Actually, you can’t manufacture that depth of connection on command)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies built community strategies around peak crisis participation and crisis-level bonding. They staffed for engagement that made sense when professional community was substituting for all community and people were processing collective trauma together. They created expectations for involvement that assumed people’s entire social lives would continue to flow through professional channels with that same intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When engagement inevitably declined, it wasn’t because the communities failed. People’s lives and needs changed, and then companies panicked. They hired more community managers. They added more features. They pushed harder for participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t solve for the absence of shared crisis with better Slack integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that shift, professional communities changed in character, not just size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many became transactional. People drop in, ask a question, get an answer, leave. They need the &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt;, the collective knowledge, the troubleshooting help, the documentation links. But they don’t want or need the &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;. They’re not looking for the coffee shop vibe anymore. They’re looking for Stack Overflow with a pulse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t everyone. Remote workers still exist. Niche specialists still need their people. Global collaborators still benefit from async communication across time zones. People for whom online professional community isn’t a substitute for anything, because it’s genuinely where their professional community exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even within those groups, the engagement looks different. It’s purposeful, not ambient. It’s “I’m here when I need something” rather than “this is where I hang out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there are the community builders caught in the middle, trying to recreate that pandemic-era connection and intimacy in product-focused communities where most people just want help with their API integration. They’re hosting office hours that get three attendees. They’re planning social events that get polite “maybe” responses. They’re fighting to build connection in spaces where the majority of members are perfectly content with drive-by interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that these community builders are doing it wrong. &lt;em&gt;They’re trying to create depth in spaces where most people want efficiency.&lt;/em&gt; They’re optimizing for belonging when most users are optimizing for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communities that thrived on trauma bonds and shared vulnerability can’t be replicated in a product community where people just need their build to work. And expecting them to is setting community builders up to burn out trying to recreate something that only existed under very specific, unrepeatable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-job-is-this-community-actually-doing&quot;&gt;What job is this community actually doing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020-2021, professional communities were doing the job of: general social connection, professional development, casual friendship, identity formation, and mental health support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, they should be doing the job of: professional knowledge sharing, specific technical support, collaboration, and professional networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are different jobs requiring different strategies, different staffing, and different success metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities that thrive post-pandemic aren’t trying to be everything to everyone. They’re specific about who they serve and why. They’re intentional about the value they provide. They recognize that lower engagement isn’t failure. It’s actually right-sizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-uncomfortable-truth&quot;&gt;The Uncomfortable Truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every company needs a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you needed one in 2020, you might not need one now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if your competitors have one, that doesn’t mean you should too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if engagement was high during the pandemic, that doesn’t mean it should be high now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies that will succeed with community in 2025 and beyond are the ones willing to ask: “Is this actually serving a real need, or are we chasing ghosts of pandemic-era metrics?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because belonging doesn’t scale the way we hoped. Identity doesn’t consolidate because we want it to. And crisis-driven engagement isn’t a sustainable business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second in a series exploring how our understanding of community has changed from 2020 to 2025. Next: How AI and changing expectations are breaking the communities that remain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When 'Local' Went Global: The Pandemic Era of International Communities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, I occupied the same space—a Zoom room-with members of the Virtual Coffee community from all over the world. We’ve had members across the US, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. We saw each other whether in an official Virtual Coffee even or eventually in our virtual co-working room that stayed open 24/7. Sometimes we’d chat. Sometimes, we’d just… exist together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the digital equivalent of running into someone in the dairy aisle, except the dairy aisle was a Zoom room, and the “someone” could be in Jakarta, São Paulo, Manchester, or Kansas City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a brief window in modern history, “local” stopped meaning geography and started meaning something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-collapse-of-default-community&quot;&gt;The Collapse of Default Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before March 2020, most of us didn’t have to think much about what “community” meant. It was simply the people you saw regularly: coworkers, neighbors, your kid’s soccer team parents, the familiar faces at church or the gym. Community was embedded in the infrastructure of daily life and was predictable, physical, and largely determined by proximity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then proximity disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When lockdowns began, the familiar networks evaporated overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact was immediate and profound. &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect2affect.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Pandemic-Effect-A-Social-Isolation-Report-AARP-Foundation.pdf&quot;&gt;Two-thirds of adults reported experiencing social isolation during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. For younger adults, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/reports/loneliness-in-america&quot;&gt;61% of young felt “serious loneliness” during this period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t lose our desire for community. We lost the infrastructure that had been quietly supporting it all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-great-virtualization&quot;&gt;The Great Virtualization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened next wasn’t entirely new. People had been building online communities for years. But the scale and speed were unprecedented. Suddenly, everyone needed to figure out how to find belonging through a screen. When the physical infrastructure disappeared, we rebuilt it digitally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From massive pandemic hackathons to new Slack and Discord communities, people everywhere began re-creating local-belonging at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started Virtual Coffee with weekly Tuesday meetings that were regular, predictable, and rhythmic. In a lot of ways, therapeutic. Then, the co-working room that transformed it into something that felt genuinely “local.” That room was open all the time. You could drop in whenever. You’d see who else was around. Sometimes you’d end up in a spontaneous conversation about your project, or someone’s career transition, or absolutely nothing at all.
We added a virtual book club, CodeWars challenges, and another day of coffee chats. Interintellect salons hosted three-hour events where people from diverse backgrounds came together for intellectually stimulating conversation, bridging tech and non-tech interests through Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic was in the serendipity. The unplanned encounters. The way you’d sign on to get work done and end up chatting with someone from Nigeria about their startup idea, or find yourself in a breakout room with a developer from Russia who was working through the same frustrating bug you’d just solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were strangers from different continents creating something that felt remarkably like what a neighborhood coffee shop might have provided. Except our “neighborhood” spanned time zones, and our “coffee shop” never closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-made-it-work&quot;&gt;What Made It Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I think the pandemic-era virtual communities that thrived shared a few key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regularity without rigidity. You knew when things were happening, but you weren’t required to show up. The co-working room was always there. The Tuesday meetings happened every Tuesday. This created rhythm, a temporal equivalent of “I know I’ll see you at the grocery store on Saturday mornings.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Space for the unplanned. I still believe that the most meaningful connections don’t happen during structured programming. They happened in the margins: before the official meeting start, in the co-working room at odd hours, in side channels where someone posted a random question and three people end up in a deep conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low barriers, high humanity. The fact that events moved online opened communities up to people who might have been too uncomfortable to attend an in-person event due to anxiety, financial constraints, or something else, allowing for realtime conversations over Slack or Discord instead of struggling with in-person social time. Nobody cared about ring lights or professional setups–ok, maybe once I learned about those things, I did invest some money to upgrade a little bit. But we still showed up in our kitchens, with kids screaming in the background, with laundry visible behind us. The bar for participation was simply: be present, be kind, be human.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shared vulnerability. We were all figuring it out together. Nobody had their shit completely sorted. That leveled the playing field in a way that’s rare in professional communities. In other words, the senior engineer and the bootcamp student/grad (ie, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;) were equally disoriented by the moment we were living through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shift-back&quot;&gt;The Shift Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, gradually, the physical world opened back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People returned to offices, or to coffee shops, gyms, schools, or co-working spaces again. The default infrastructure of community came back in-person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the international local communities… shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The co-working room got quieter. The Tuesday meetings still happen, but attendance has thinned. Not because people stopped caring, but because they could now get some of those needs met in physical space again. Time—everyone’s most finite resource—got redistributed back to the in-person world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, people spent the bulk of their social time at work, and remote work led to loneliness and feeling disconnected. The shared physical space offered opportunities to network, mentor others, and build community that were hard to recreate in a scattered, virtual workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t a failure. It was just the natural consequence of changed circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it left a lot of questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-we-are-now&quot;&gt;Where We Are Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in a strange liminal space. Virtual communities haven’t disappeared, but they’re not serving the same function they did in 2020-2022. The urgency is gone. Community programs saw an increased recognition of their value during the pandemic, but that recognition was tied to a specific moment in time—a moment that has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are negotiating between physical and digital belonging in ways we haven’t fully figured out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And meanwhile, companies are asking: “Why isn’t our community as engaged as it was during the pandemic?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right question is: &lt;em&gt;“Who actually needs this community now, and what are we building it for?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, virtual communities weren’t just filling a professional need. They were filling all our social needs. Professional community became a substitute for general community because it was all we had. The developer slack was my coffee shop, my gym, my after-work happy hour, my weekend hangout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that general social needs can be met locally again for many people, the population who needs online-as-local has shifted back to who it always was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully remote workers who’ve left physical proximity to colleagues behind entirely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers who want casual peer conversation without the overhead of professional networking events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who want the hallway track experience (those serendipitous conversations that happen between sessions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specialists in niche areas where their “local” doesn’t have anyone else working on their specific stack or problem domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disabled folks, caretakers, and others for whom physical gatherings have always been inaccessible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Global collaborators building projects across continents and time zones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who want the coffee shop, but the coffee shop is all technies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These communities still matter deeply. They’re still someone’s local. The mistake isn’t that these communities exist—it’s that companies think everyone needs this, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee shop didn’t disappear; it just got quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;redefining-local-again&quot;&gt;Redefining Local, Again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The always-on, drop-in, developer coffee shop model didn’t stop working. It just stopped being universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020-2022, everyone needed it because everyone was isolated. In 2025, it serves a specific population: people whose physical environment doesn’t provide the technical community they need. This isn’t new. This population always existed. The pandemic just temporarily made everyone part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confusion comes from companies who saw engagement numbers during lockdown and thought, “This is what community looks like now.” They built strategies around peak-crisis participation and are now wondering why engagement dropped when the crisis ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the people who are fully remote, who do work in niche areas, who actually need virtual-as-local? The future of virtual community isn’t choosing between “always-on” and “seasonal engagement.” It’s recognizing that different models serve different needs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always-on spaces for people who need virtual-as-local (remote workers, niche specialists, global teams)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Event-driven communities for people who have local networks but want to expand them occasionally&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Project-based cohorts for people collaborating on specific initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hybrid models that acknowledge some members need daily presence while others drop in monthly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief era when local went global taught us something important about what community actually requires. Not geography. Not even, proximity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhythm, serendipity, and the willingness to show up wherever you are and be &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those needs haven’t disappeared. But the population experiencing them has returned to its pre-pandemic size—still significant, still vital, just less universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now is: can we build sustainable models for the people who actually need virtual-as-local, without expecting everyone to need it all the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series exploring how our understanding of community has changed from 2020 to 2025. Next: Why companies misread the moment and built communities for everyone when they should have built for someone. When the world redefined community, companies thought they could scale it. But belonging doesn’t scale, at least, not the way they hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Developer’s Guide to Choosing an AI Coding Assistant That Boosts Productivity Without Overwhelming Your Workflow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding the assistant that fits just right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt; over the last year, we’ve been talking about our experiences with different AI Coding Assistants.  Some of the things I’ve heard include, “It felt like I was constantly being interrupted,” “I barely notice it’s there until I need it,” “Sometimes it feels like it’s micromanaging me, so I turn it off.” A lot of times, it’s the same tool with different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/bekahhw/series/32242&quot;&gt;Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been writing about my journey to find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; coding assistant&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought it would be useful to distill what I’ve learned so far into a simple guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I’m calling this “The Goldilocks Problem.” Some AI coding assistants are too intrusive, some are too passive, and some are just right. But that sweet spot depends entirely on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is designed to help you find an AI assistant that enhances your workflow without hijacking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-understand-the-types-of-ai-assistant-behavior&quot;&gt;Step 1: Understand the Types of AI Assistant Behavior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI tools fall along a spectrum based on how actively they interact with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-the-background-helper-minimal-intrusion&quot;&gt;1. The Background Helper (Minimal Intrusion)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quiet until called upon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great for deep-focus devs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acts like autocomplete on demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-the-proactive-partner-moderate-intrusion&quot;&gt;2. The Proactive Partner (Moderate Intrusion)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offers smart suggestions as you type&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balances guidance with control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideal for those who like nudges but not noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-the-active-collaborator-high-intrusion&quot;&gt;3. The Active Collaborator (High Intrusion)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suggests proactively, refactors on its own&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes takes initiative beyond what you asked&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best for devs who want maximum AI assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be fun for vibe coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-audit-your-workflow-style&quot;&gt;Step 2: Audit Your Workflow Style&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right assistant depends on how you work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-kind-of-coder-are-you&quot;&gt;What kind of coder are you?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flow-state coder&lt;/strong&gt;: You need focus and minimal interruptions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burst coder&lt;/strong&gt;: You are energized by context-switching and quick input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-breaks-your-concentration&quot;&gt;What breaks your concentration?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are popups or suggestions distracting?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you lose focus without a prompt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-do-you-prefer-to-learn&quot;&gt;How do you prefer to learn?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn-by-doing&lt;/strong&gt;: Prefer code patterns and examples&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn-by-understanding&lt;/strong&gt;: Need deep explanations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-match-assistant-style-to-your-workflow&quot;&gt;Step 3: Match Assistant Style to Your Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know how you work, you can align that with the assistant type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-1-invisible-until-needed&quot;&gt;Option 1: Invisible Until Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for&lt;/strong&gt;: Experienced devs who want help with boilerplate, syntax, and docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-assistant-features-to-look-for&quot;&gt;What Assistant Features to Look for&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before committing, test tools with these 5 workflow scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Morning Startup Test
Does the AI help you pick up where you left off, or get in the way?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Deep Focus Test
Can you stay in flow, or does it interrupt too much?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Context Switch Test
Does it keep up when jumping between files and tasks?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Learning Moment Test
When you hit something unfamiliar, does it help you understand?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Cleanup Test
Can you read and modify the AI’s code later?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-signs-an-ai-assistant-is-helping-or-hurting-your-workflow&quot;&gt;Step 5: Signs an AI Assistant Is Helping Or Hurting Your Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-flags-its-disrupting-your-workflow&quot;&gt;Red Flags (It’s disrupting your workflow)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Constantly fighting the suggestions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code quality or clarity drops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You rely on it so much that you can’t code solo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You feel anxious when it’s off. (Maybe it’s time to see a therapist too :joy: )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;green-flags-its-enhancing-your-workflow&quot;&gt;Green Flags (It’s enhancing your workflow)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You forget it’s there until you need it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re learning new patterns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You feel more confident and productive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr-finding-the-right-fit-ai-coding-assistant&quot;&gt;TL;DR: Finding the Right-Fit AI Coding Assistant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for an AI assistant that boosts productivity without overwhelming your workflow try GitHub Copilot or Continue.dev if you prefer minimal interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose tools with gentle, context-aware prompts if you want help but not takeover. Explore Cursor or advanced Continue setups for high-involvement AI assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pros and Cons of the Top AI Code Assistants: Continue.dev, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor (With a Hero’s Twist)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every great hero needs the right weapon. Captain America has his shield, Aragorn wields Andúril, and David brought down Goliath with nothing but a slingshot and unshakeable faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As developers, facing the giants of legacy code, impossible challenges, and the eternal question, “Can you just add one small feature?”, having the right “weapon” can mean the difference in how successful we are. The AI coding assistant landscape is about finding your legendary weapon. It’s about choosing our superhero origin story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hero Archetype:&lt;/strong&gt; The resourceful underdog who’s powers lie in adaptability and cleverness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For the battles aren’t won by size, but by skill and choosing your shot”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-metaphor-davids-slingshot&quot;&gt;The Metaphor: David’s Slingshot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone expected David to suit up in Saul’s armor, but he looked at that heavy gear and said, “Nah, I’m good with my slingshot.” That’s Continue.dev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other tools come loaded with corporate armor and preset strategies, Continue says, “Here’s your slingshot. You choose the stones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shape-shifting: Works with any AI model you choose (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stealth mode: Can run everything locally&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weapon crafting: Custom assistant creation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open source: Driven by community improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slight learning curve for setup and workflows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less polished UI than commercial tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Requires some config to reach full power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-for&quot;&gt;Best For:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers who’ve been burned by vendor lock-in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power users who want full control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyone building their own coding workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hero Archetype:&lt;/strong&gt; The steadfast leader who inspires confidence through consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I can do this all day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-metaphor-captain-americas-shield&quot;&gt;The Metaphor: Captain America’s Shield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Avenger, the one who established what it means to be an AI coding assistant. Steve Rogers’ shield isn’t flashy. It doesn’t shoot lasers. But it’s reliable, trusted by the team, and always ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros-1&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unbreakable consistency: Works the same way every time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team integration: Easy to roll out across orgs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Battle-tested: Millions of developers rely on it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seamless with VS Code and GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons-1&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Occasionally hallucinates or misinterprets intentions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offers limited insight into &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things break&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not ideal for deeper refactoring or debugging scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-for-1&quot;&gt;Best For:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers who want plug-and-play completion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teams looking for low-friction onboarding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fast-paced shipping of small features or fixes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Reforged from the shards of what came before”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-metaphor-aragorns-andúril&quot;&gt;The Metaphor: Aragorn’s Andúril&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reforged from the shards of what came before, Cursor is VS Code reborn and transformed into something powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros-2&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Royal bloodline: Built on VS Code’s foundation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI-first vision: UI centered around AI workflows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multi-realm mastery: Understands and edits your whole codebase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Composer magic: Suggests multi-file implementations intelligently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons-2&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Premium pricing tiers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can make sweeping changes outside of scope&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Might be overwhelming for newer devs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-for-2&quot;&gt;Best For:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers who want deep AI collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Projects involving large-scale refactors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those ready to go “all in” on an AI-native IDE&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Debugging Mobile Navigation Bugs with AI Code Assistants: Continue vs Copilot vs Cursor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A follow-up to “Which Code Assistant Actually Helps Developers Grow?” This time, testing how AI assistants handle debugging existing code problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bekahhw.com/Which-Code-Assistant-Helps-Developers-Grow&quot;&gt;tested three AI coding assistants on building a new feature&lt;/a&gt;. This time, I wanted to see how they handle something most developers deal with daily: debugging existing code problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was debugging a mobile responsiveness issue on my Astro + Tailwind site (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BekahHW/siblings-write/&quot;&gt;GitHub Project here&lt;/a&gt;). The navbar wasn’t collapsing on mobile, causing layout issues. Instead of a full navigation bar cramming into mobile view, I needed a proper hamburger menu. Instead of manually rewriting it, I tested how three AI code assistants—Continue, Copilot, and Cursor—would solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/240b8dcxjht9ly0hg9v1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif showing the responsive layout issue on mobile is fixed when deleting the nav bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I told each assistant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There’s an issue with mobile view on the site. I think the main problem is with the navbar. But I don’t think it makes sense to have a nav bar for a mobile site. We should make the site responsive and add a sticky nav bar with a hamburger menu instead of the full navigation bar once the site hits mobile-sized screens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: I tested Continue, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor to debug a broken mobile navbar in an Astro-based site. Continue offered the best explanations and teaching moments, Cursor was fast but made extra assumptions, and Copilot was fast but error-prone. If you’re debugging UI bugs, Continue’s Chat mode helps you understand why things break, not just how to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-continue-debug-a-responsive-nav-issue-in-astro&quot;&gt;Can Continue Debug a Responsive Nav Issue in Astro?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://continue.dev/&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.continue.dev/agent/how-to-use-it&quot;&gt;Agent mode&lt;/a&gt;, giving it context from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Header.astro&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nav.astro&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BaseLayout.astro&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bg21110n6vfs19es00l5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Continue.dev suggesting hamburger menu fixes in Astro project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a dedicated hamburger menu component&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asked for permission between file changes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I got a transparency issue with the menu panel, it fixed it in one go&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It added comments to understand the steps it was taking in the code and debug logs in the code to help me see what was working and when&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything worked within 12 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-learning-experience&quot;&gt;The Learning Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tested the same fix using Continue’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.continue.dev/chat/how-to-use-it&quot;&gt;Chat mode&lt;/a&gt; instead of Agent mode, it took longer but provided much more thorough explanations. The conversation was more educational, walking me through the reasoning behind each change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue balances efficiency with learning. Agent mode got me working code fast, while Chat mode taught me the “why” behind the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ss3rdoqhm59mkjjqxbl.png&quot; alt=&quot;Copilot output showing approach to fixing broken layout with overlapping nav menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-copilot-handles-responsive-navbar-bugs&quot;&gt;How Copilot Handles Responsive Navbar Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copilot started by unnecessarily converting a Svelte component, then immediately threw a TypeScript error:
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Argument of type 'EventTarget' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Node'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why it decided that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ThemeToggleButton&lt;/code&gt; needed to be converted. At the very least, that’s outside of the scope of this PR, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fi883ls0s34e83ux1zra.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image description&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was able to solve the problem pretty quickly when I used the “Fix with Copilot” function, explaining, “You should cast e.target to Node when passing it to .contains() to resolve the type error.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-real-problem&quot;&gt;The Real Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hamburger menu initially didn’t appear at all. The responsiveness was “fixed” because the navigation disappeared, but users couldn’t access any menu items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After back-and-forth debugging, Copilot resorted to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; declarations (not ideal) and the old “turn the background red” debugging trick. Even when the menu became visible, clicking it did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we identified JavaScript as the culprit. Copilot fixed it, but then the menu links appeared directly over the page content without any background container. More back-and-forth with questionable styling decisions followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was to the point where I definitely could fix this faster than having a back-and-forth with Copilot, so I called it. After that, I also realized there was a bug where, after expanding the hamburger menu on mobile and then switching to desktop view, the mobile menu remained open on top of the restored navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tvvd7pmfl9gm2usc0k1w.png&quot; alt=&quot;nav panel on top of page text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;: About 20 minutes, with me ultimately fixing the styles myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Value&lt;/strong&gt;: Minimal. Copilot told me what it was doing, but didn’t really explain its approach or help me understand the underlying problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cursor-fixes-more-than-you-askhelpful-or-harmful&quot;&gt;Cursor Fixes More Than You Ask—Helpful or Harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cursor’s response was immediate and organized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7vx5vt6fdw9b2utz4gre.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cursor's initial message detailing what needed to be done to implement the hamburger menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically read the global CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outlined exactly what needed to change and why&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provided all necessary file updates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hit the same cross-page JavaScript issue as Copilot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-interesting-part&quot;&gt;The Interesting Part&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cursor went beyond my request, automatically improving mobile styles across the site that I hadn’t asked for. This raises an interesting question: should AI assistants make assumptions about what you “really” need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;: About 15 minutes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Value&lt;/strong&gt;: Good explanations of changes. I appreciate that it gives more information on why errors were happening in the context of using Astro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vsk81fkbeau7jkmdtafh.png&quot; alt=&quot;showing the issue and how it understands and corrects it&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;context-switching-costs&quot;&gt;Context Switching Costs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s something I noticed that none of the assistants addressed: familiarity bias. Cursor and GitHub Copilot felt nearly identical to use, so I moved faster with them. Continue required slightly more of a learning curve, which actually slowed me down initially but provided better educational value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a knock against Continue. It’s a reminder that switching tools comes with costs, even when the new tool might be better in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;debugging-vs-building-different-skills-required&quot;&gt;Debugging vs. Building: Different Skills Required&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This debugging scenario revealed something my first test missed, that building new features and fixing existing problems require different AI assistance approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-new-features&quot;&gt;Building New Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blank slate approach&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on “what should this do?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;debugging-existing-code&quot;&gt;Debugging Existing Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding legacy decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifying root causes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on “why isn’t this working?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue did well with the debugging mindset, asking permission before changes and explaining the reasoning. Copilot and Cursor were more aggressive about “fixing” things, sometimes creating new problems in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-ai-coding-assistant-wins-for-debugging&quot;&gt;Which AI Coding Assistant Wins for Debugging?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Continue, especially in Chat mode. It helped me understand not just what was broken, but why the original approach failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Speed&lt;/strong&gt;: Cursor, if you don’t mind AI making assumptions about improvements you didn’t request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bigger-picture&quot;&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comparison reinforced something I mentioned in my first post: the tool is only part of the equation. Each assistant performed differently not just because of their capabilities, but because of how they approached the problem-solving process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue treated debugging as a learning opportunity. Copilot treated it as a code completion task. Cursor treated it as a comprehensive redesign project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know which coding assistant helps developers grow when you’re debugging, try this: Before asking for a fix, ask the AI to help you understand why the original code failed. The debugging skills you develop will be more valuable than any individual fix.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Which Code Assistant Actually Helps Developers Grow?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve had a ton of conversations at &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt; about AI. If you’ve opened up X or LinkedIn, you probably realize that people have very strong opinions about AI. At Virtual Coffee, we’re a pretty close-knit community, so there are a lot of concerns about the impacts of AI, how junior developers grow (or stay stagnant) with AI, whether or not to adopt it as a team, and whether to use it without telling your boss. At the heart of a lot of these conversations is the feeling that you’re somehow “cheating” if you use AI, and that you won’t learn or grow if you’re using it. I think the sentiment comes from the right place, caring about people, but I think there are a lot of options and approaches you can take to prevent that. I believe that when we consider the evolving landscape in tech, we also need to think about the changing landscape of tech education. Most of us will end up using AI in our workflow, either out of necessity or because our team mandates it. That’s why I also think that AI coding assistants actually have the ability to help everyone grow in ways they couldn’t before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ykdojo/status/1932149031196856738&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6unkesc921s6jw892qz6.png&quot; alt=&quot;ykdogo tweet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-vs-speed-trap&quot;&gt;Learning vs. Speed Trap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your approach to learning with AI assistants definitely matters. And not all AI coding assistants will help increase developers’ coding skills. Learning about the code you’re writing, how your team approaches problems, and how to utilize AI as part of your workflow is necessary to grow in tech. Teams don’t need someone who can prompt their way to a working solution but can’t debug it when it breaks. Most AI coding assistants are optimized for speed and not for learning. They’re designed to get you from problem to solution as quickly as possible. If your goal is skill development, you should think of AI adoption more like onboarding a mentor, rather than replacing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;context-aware-guidance&quot;&gt;Context-Aware Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective learning-focused assistants should understand what you’re trying to do and what you should learn from doing it. They highlight patterns, point out potential issues, and suggest alternative approaches that might teach you something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m testing out a couple of AI coding assistants on a new feature. (I’m interested in doing a follow-up post that uses it on an existing file. Let me know if that’s something you’d like to see!)  I tested out each coding assistant on a new feature I’m adding to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siblingswrite.com/&quot;&gt;writing site&lt;/a&gt;, with this simple prompt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to create a game for this site, where people (not logged in) can add a word to a story. Once the story hits 300 words, it locks the submission. No one should be able to submit more than 3 words in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my takeaways for Continue, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. I gave the same initial prompt for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;continue&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://continue.dev/&quot;&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt; stands out here because their philosophy explicitly addresses the learning problem. Their documentation talks about “amplifying intent” rather than replacing it, and they specifically warn against becoming a “human clipboard.” You can explore ideas through “vibe coding” during creative phases, but when it comes to production work, they emphasize that developers need to stay in control. It’s open source, model-flexible (bring your own LLM), and encourages creating custom assistants that reinforce your team’s coding standards. For teams focused on growth and increasing their developers’ coding skills, Continue offers both transparency and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before giving me any kind of code, it gave me an initial planning response, outlining a step-by-step approach to the user story. Seeing the plan helps the user to walk through the task with Continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uuws98nat1n8qrflz4nn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overview of the approach Continue takes to implement feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, it provided commented code along with a reusable template. The inline comments break down some of the logic, and helps the user understand the process it went through to generate the code. After the code, it summarized all the changes it had made. 
You might notice it mentions Flask, but this is actually an Astro app. That was my mistake. When I initially set up the assistant, I had configured it with Python-focused instructions and directed it to Python documentation, since my rules were originally written for a Python assistant. Once I updated those settings and specifically shared my repository with the assistant, Continue was able to properly follow my project’s styling conventions and leverage the existing components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it gave both an overview of what was implemented and ideas for improvement. I appreciate that it provided more context about its approach, commented code throughout the new file, and offered inspiration for my next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3iwg6njdy7a2fk8plmf8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overview of the approach it took and the improvements I could make&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without having to ask further questions about the decisions it made and the approach it took, I think it provided a good amount of context for the developer to understand the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;copilot&quot;&gt;Copilot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/copilot/&quot;&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt; is known for excelling at code completion and includes agent-based features. It can speed up repetitive tasks, but the learning tends to happen through osmosis. You need to recognize the patterns in suggestions and might pick them up over time. You have to be more active with your learning by asking Copilot about the decisions it made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copilot’s approach was a lot different from Continue’s. It jumps straight into code generation without context-setting or explanation of its approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did provide a “wrap up” after the code, but it wasn’t as thorough or complete as what I got from Continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3wmwmu4lse15u873zasm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wrap up of the implementation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, Copilot also told me that creating a Svelte component was the best option, and then, when I questioned it, Copilot told me that Astro was actually the best path. It was flexible with the approach once I questioned it, but it definitely required me to go down the rabbit hole with it. Learning is definitely passive with Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cursor&quot;&gt;Cursor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cursor.com/&quot;&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt; offers an AI-first editor experience with agent modes, but their emphasis on “AI that builds with you” raises questions about how much actual building the developer is doing during complex tasks. Although I’m just doing a basic test for this post with a brand new feature, I did experiment a bit with its interactive, AI-native IDE experience by highlighting some of the code it generated and asking, “What does this do?” I plan on doing more of that in a follow-up post for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being given the same prompt as Continue and Copilot, Cursor walked me through the approach it was taking and included what files it looked at to get there. However, it automatically created a Svelte file for the game (I did have Svelte installed in the project), and I had to do a lot of back and forth with it to understand the decisions it made and why. I’ve actually never used Svelte, so this was something I had to dig into deeper to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g2kk5qu91tqrqk2ewtc3.png&quot; alt=&quot;initial overview of the approach&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I appreciated about Cursor’s experience was that it explained piece by piece and required me to accept changes. That forces the user to think about what’s being implemented. It also auto-corrected some of its own errors, which is a good learning opportunity to see how it debugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/317dusccwjklrckjxf0s.png&quot; alt=&quot;explaining where the issues lies in the error&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish it would have automatically added code comments throughout, but the explanations were valuable. The takeaways at the end walked through what the user could do and the functionality. It was more thorough than Copilot, but I liked the improvements suggestion that Continue had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ailxygg7jc0uprc177n0.png&quot; alt=&quot;wrap up of features and how it works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-learning-first-ai-strategy&quot;&gt;Building a Learning-First AI Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this exploration is important for new folks coming into tech, and for teams serious about using AI to help their team grow and not just ship faster. The path here should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with Intent&lt;/strong&gt;: Before adding any AI tool to your workflow or your team’s, clearly define your goals. Are you trying to help yourself or junior developers on the team understand architectural patterns? Learn a new framework? Improve code review skills?
Different learning goals might call for different AI approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Tools with Teaching DNA&lt;/strong&gt;: Look for AI assistants that were designed with education in mind, not just productivity. Continue’s emphasis on amplifying developer intent rather than replacing it is a good example of this thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement Learning Safeguards&lt;/strong&gt;: Whatever tool you choose, build processes that encourage learning by requiring explanations for AI-generated solutions, having regular code review focused on understanding, not just correctness, adding pair programming sessions where AI suggestions become discussion points, documenting decisions and trade-offs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure Learning, Not Just Output&lt;/strong&gt;: Track whether your developers are asking better questions over time, not just whether they’re closing tickets faster. Are they suggesting alternatives during code review? Can they debug issues in AI-generated code? Are they learning patterns they can apply without AI assistance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want developers who are using AI to understand problems. That’s the difference between an AI assistant and an AI mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best AI coding assistant for individuals and teams focuses on developer skill growth. Based on philosophy, approach, and explicit focus on learning, Continue seems to understand this distinction better than most. But the tool is only part of the equation. The bigger part is approaching AI adoption with learning as the primary goal, not just productivity.
The most productive teams and developers understand what they’re building, whether with or without AI help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comparing 5 AI Coding Assistants: Which One's Right for You?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeromehardaway_microsoft-ceo-admits-that-ai-is-generating-activity-7340817881154134016-Ld9Q&quot;&gt;Jerome Hardaway’s LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt;, and it really resonated with me. I like the idea of thinking of AI coding tools as “really great intern[s]. Fast, helpful, capable in the right hands – but still needs supervision, clear direction, and someone to clean up afterward.” There are a couple of projects that I’m working on this summer: the author site that I share with my brothers that uses Astro, a new project I’m launching for &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss-communities.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;osscommunities.com&lt;/a&gt;. This seems like the perfect opportunity to find the right tool that’s worth adding tool to my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ah6h6875jlzj6p5oknx4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jerome Hardaway's full post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-ai-assistant-philosophy&quot;&gt;My AI Assistant Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a proponent of using AI just like any other tool in your toolbox. It’s there to help you level up, work more effectively, and move faster. If I were a carpenter who was too afraid or skeptical to try a hammer, I wouldn’t be as effective as other carpenters. And honestly, as a mom of four, I’ve been looking for ways to be more efficient for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, your coding assistant is only as good as you guide it to be. You have to make sure to correct it when it hallucinates, to double-check its work, to help it understand what you actually need. For me, it’s all about finding the best partner for the work I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-assistant-tools--their-promises&quot;&gt;AI Assistant Tools &amp;amp; Their Promises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose these five AI coding assistants based on different approaches to the same problem: Continue.dev for its open source flexibility and developer-first philosophy, Cursor for its AI-native editor approach, GitHub Copilot as the established market leader, Tabnine for its enterprise angle, and Windsurf as the rebranded dark horse. In my opinion, these represent the current landscape of AI code completion tools, from open source flexibility to enterprise privacy to AI-first design philosophies. Here’s a little more on each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-continuedev&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://continue.dev/&quot;&gt;Continue.dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their Promise&lt;/em&gt;:  Amplify developers, don’t replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Expectation&lt;/em&gt;:  I think Continue.dev’s chat, autocomplete, edit, and agent modes in one tool sounds interesting and comprehensive. I’m hoping this flexibility translates to better suggestions for my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-github-copilot&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/copilot/&quot;&gt;GitHub CoPilot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their Promise&lt;/em&gt;:  AI that builds with you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Expectation&lt;/em&gt;:  I’ve used CoPilot before, so this is the obvious choice since I already have experience with it. But I’m really curious to compare it to other tools out there to see how it stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-cursor&quot;&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cursor.com&quot;&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their Promise&lt;/em&gt;:  Cursor is a powerful AI-first code editor that enhances your development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Expectation&lt;/em&gt;:  The real test for me is whether building the editor around AI from day one actually feels different than VS Code with AI-extensions and whether or not the experience feels disjointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-tabnine&quot;&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tabnine.com/&quot;&gt;Tabnine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their Promise&lt;/em&gt;:  Tabnine claims that it is the world’s most contextually aware AI software development platform, helping mature engineering teams speed up and simplify
their entire development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Expectation&lt;/em&gt;:  They seem to be targeting enterprise developers, but I’m curious if their focus on “mature engineering teams” translates to better suggestions for solo projects like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-windsurf&quot;&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://windsurf.com/about&quot;&gt;Windsurf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their Promise&lt;/em&gt;:  Windsurf is a next-generation AI IDE built to keep you in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Expectation&lt;/em&gt;: The “dream bigger” messaging is heavy on inspiration, but there’s not a lot of specifics. I want to see how well that translates to the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not looking for the tool that writes the most code for me.  I’m looking for the best AI coding assistant that makes me a better developer while helping me ship faster. The goal isn’t just to find another autocomplete tool. My goal is to discover which AI code assistant deserves a permanent spot in my development workflow. Whether that ends up being Continue.dev’s customizable approach, Cursor’s seamless integration, or one of the other contenders, I’ll share what I’ve learned in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for the full AI coding assistant comparison and see which tool actually lives up to the productivity promises.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Test Drive Before You Buy: Your Guide to AI Code Assistant Trials in 2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bekahhw.com/Taking-Time-to-Breathe-A-New-Chapter-Begins&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about spending time this summer looking at different AI tools. I want to get hands-on, figure out what I want to integrate into my workflow. But before I spend time (and money) testing things out, I wanted to start with the free/trial periods. So you’re starting at the beginning of this journey with me. The question that I started with is: Which AI code assistants will actually let me take them for a proper test drive? In this post, I’ll share what I found across five top AI Coding Assistants—Continue, Windsurf, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Tabnine—and what I’m interested in learning as I put them to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-trial-landscape-whats-actually-available-with-ai-assistants&quot;&gt;The Trial Landscape: What’s Actually Available with AI Assistants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After digging through pricing pages, here’s what you can try without putting in your credit card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://continue.dev/&quot;&gt;Continue.dev&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most flexible and accessible AI Coding Assistants out there.  It’s open source, which means you can literally use it forever for free if you just bring your own API keys, and it supports any model you choose, including Claude 4 Sonnet, 4o, llama3.1 8b. Continue’s IDE extension has gained a lot of recent attention (20K+ GitHub stars), and integrates into tools that you might already use (VS Code and JetBrains). You can also create public assistants and invite your entire team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://windsurf.com/&quot;&gt;Windsurf&lt;/a&gt; surprised me here. Their free tier includes 25 prompt credits per month, all premium models, unlimited Fast Tab completions, and even a 2-week Pro trial to test the advanced features. Built by the Codeium team, it’s essentially giving you a full-featured AI IDE for nothing. The supercomplete feature claims to understand your entire workspace to give intelligent suggestions across files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;tabnine.com&quot;&gt;Tabnine&lt;/a&gt; offers a “Dev Preview” that’s completely free for qualified users, giving you AI code completions for current line and multiple lines, plus AI-powered chat. There’s also a paid Dev plan at $9/month with more advanced features. The Dev plan includes their foundational AI agents that can autonomously generate code, tests, docs, and fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;cursor.com&quot;&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt; gives you a Pro two-week trial as part of their free Hobby plan, plus 2,000 completions to play with. After that, their Pro plan is $20/month. It’s a significant jump but with unlimited agent requests and tab completions, two weeks is enough time to test their agent mode on a real project and see if the autonomous coding capabilities live up to the hype.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/copilot&quot;&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt; offers a solid 30-day free trial on their Pro plan before charging $10/month. Thirty days is actually enough time to see if it clicks with your workflow or just generates more bugs than it fixes. Since it’s deeply integrated in the GitHub ecosystem, you’ll be able to see how well it understands project context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-actually-test-during-your-trial&quot;&gt;What to Actually Test During Your Trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to avoid some of the common problems I hear developers talk about when they sign up for AI Coding Assistants. I want to do more than test drive a car and park it in a lot. Here’s the approach I’m trying to take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-real-world-gauntlet&quot;&gt;The Real-World Gauntlet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test it on your actual codebase.&lt;/strong&gt; I have some existing projects that I’ve created over the years. My blog is a Jekyll site that I have done only enough updating to keep things running over the past couple of years. It definitely has some “why did past me write this” code in the codebase. I want to make sure that AI can handle past me. (I’m actually interested in creating a Continue assistant to help update my Jekyll site.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it on unfamiliar territory.&lt;/strong&gt; I need my AI Coding Assistant to be a force multiplier. When I’m working in my strengths, it doesn’t take me as long. But when I use it with code that I’m not super familiar with, I need it to be good. I don’t want it to help me write bad code faster. Test both scenarios. I have a new project I’ve been wanting to work on, and this seems like a good use case.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See how it handles context.&lt;/strong&gt; Can it understand your team’s coding conventions? Does it remember what you were working on five files ago? Context awareness separates the good from the great. This is not applicable for what I’m working on right now, but this is super important if you’re working with a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-stress-test&quot;&gt;The Stress Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try to push these tools to their breaking point. (Semi-related, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AIMemory/comments/1lg6axl/so_our_smartest_llms_kind_of_give_up_when_we_need/&quot;&gt;I posted about LLMs giving up when we need them the most. Feel free to add to the conversation!&lt;/a&gt; Ask them to refactor a complex function. Have them write tests for edge cases you know are problematic. See if they can debug that one weird issue that’s been haunting your team for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to find the AI Assistant that fails gracefully and teaches you something useful in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hidden-costs&quot;&gt;The Hidden Costs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the trial period becomes really important. Most AI assistants have usage-based pricing that can get out of hand really quick. You can eat through your budget if you’re not careful. During your trial, pay attention to those usage meters since they’re previewing your future bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the free tiers. Continue if you want maximum control, Windsurf if you want simplicity, Tabnine if you just want better autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the trial period to answer this question: Does this tool make you a better developer, or just a faster typist? At the end of the day, you’re responsible for all production code you ship. If you don’t understand your code, AI is a temporary solution to your problem, and that approach can end badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s your homework (and we can do it together, just comment which one you’re testing below!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick one tool from the list above&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set it up on your current project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use it for a week on real work (not tutorials)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask yourself: “Am I learning, or just copying?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on starting with Continue and working my way through the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right AI assistant will enhance and amplify your skills, not replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taking Time to Breathe: A New Chapter Begins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As of June 1st, I’m no longer with the Linux Foundation. While I’ll share more details about this transition in a future post, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through an acquisition is intense, especially when you’re leaving what was truly your favorite job. The experience has been both professionally enriching and personally challenging, and I’ve realized how important it is to give yourself permission to pause and process major changes rather than immediately jumping into the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s exactly what I’m doing this summer: taking a pragmatic approach to my career and family life. I’m giving myself time to breathe, to explore opportunities I didn’t have bandwidth for before, and to be intentional about my next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-coming-this-summer&quot;&gt;What’s Coming This Summer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary focus for the coming months will be diving deep into AI tools and their practical applications. I’ve been wanting to explore more AI tools, but I haven’t had the time to until now. As someone who’s spent considerable time thinking about content strategy and audience development, I’m fascinated by how AI is reshaping not just what we create, but how we create it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can expect a lot of AI-related content from me in the weeks ahead. I don’t have an exact plan mapped out, so it might be everything from tool reviews and practical use cases to my thoughts on how these technologies are changing the content landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have more to share about my long-term plans soon, but for now, I’m embracing this period of exploration. Thanks for following along on this journey. The next few months should be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beyond Stars and Forks: Why Open Source Needs Better Collaboration Metrics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss&quot;&gt;Intro to Open Source&lt;/a&gt; course, one of the biggest painpoints we noted with new contributors was the frustration they felt when their PRs weren’t merged in in what they felt was a reasonable amount of time. They had done their research, found an issue, gotten assigned, and then…nothing. No feedback. No merge. Just silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a familiar story. I’ve had contributors tell me, “My PR has been sitting there for two weeks and I haven’t heard a thing.” And I get it. There are so many reasons this happens, including burnout, abandoned projects, the lottery factor, and it’s rarely about bad intentions. That’s why I always tell contributors to join the community before contributing. It helps you understand the project’s rhythms, how to communicate with maintainers, and whether it’s a space that supports new members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read anything I’ve written in the last five years, you know I care deeply about the open source community. But how we have traditionally evaluated projects and metrics doesn’t give enough insight into the most meaningful parts. A lot of times, these metrics—stars, forks, downloads, and DORA metrics—miss the most important part of the story: how people collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-approach-to-open-source-metrics&quot;&gt;A Different Approach to Open Source Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/saucedopen/status/1900339926832734635&quot;&gt;OpenSauced shut down&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been exploring different options for understanding the collaboration problem. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://collab.dev/&quot;&gt;Collab.dev&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a replacement for OpenSauced, but it’s telling a different (and important) part of the story and capturing how people collaborate. It surfaces the human patterns behind the code, like review responsiveness, contributor distribution, and merge dynamics. Industry-accepted metrics like DORA are valuable for understanding software delivery performance, but not so much in the human department. They can tell you how fast code gets deployed, but not whether contributors feel supported, welcomed, or left in the dark. Open source is as much about relationships as releases, and we need metrics that reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-collaboration-visibility-gap&quot;&gt;The Collaboration Visibility Gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t just that our current metrics are incomplete. Vanity metrics have been touted as meaningful indications of the project’s health, and, to be direct, they’re just not that important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we consider the challenges maintainers face every day, we’ll see that it’s often difficult to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify which contributors are most likely to become long-term participants.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pinpoint exactly where the review process stalls or breaks down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand if the community environment genuinely feels welcoming to newcomers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distinguish between sustainable growth and problematic scaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path isn’t clearer for potential contributors either. They often struggle to determine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whether the project actively reviews and merges community contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long it typically takes for contributions to be reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which maintainers are most responsive in the contributor’s area of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there’s a healthy balance between contributions from the core team and the wider community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of us, we have to make a decision about where to invest our time and energy. It can be a real letdown if we’ve invested time and realized we made the wrong decision, coming out of it with nothing to really show for the work we’ve done. For instance, I wanted to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dub.sh/cognee&quot;&gt;cognee&lt;/a&gt;, an AI Memory management framework, recently, so I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dub.sh/cognee-collab&quot;&gt;collab.dev cognee page&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the collaboration happening. When you first look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dub.sh/cognee-gh&quot;&gt;cognee on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like a growing open source project with a decent star count, active issues, and regular commits. But looking at Collab.dev’s dashboard, I get a richer story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-story-cognees-data-tells-through-collabdev&quot;&gt;The Story Cognee’s Data Tells through Collab.dev&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;contributor-distribution&quot;&gt;Contributor Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think about good contributor distribution in an open source project, that usually means responsibilities, activity, and knowledge aren’t tied to a few people. Distribution allows for decreased burnout, project resilience, and creates a more welcoming environment. What we see with cognee is a genuinely balanced project. With 51% of contributions coming from the core team and 49% from the community, cognee has built real community ownership without abandoning maintainer responsibility, and we can make a connection with a collaborative environment and higher motivation to support the project from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/neq300a2e09po9wobend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Contributor distribution graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pr-lifecycle-metrics&quot;&gt;PR Lifecycle Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It continues to get interesting. The review funnel shows that 88% of PRs receive reviews and 85.2% get approved. That approval rate tells a story about quality control and contributor experience. It suggests that either the project has excellent contribution guidelines that help people submit good PRs, or the maintainers are actively helping contributors improve their work rather than just rejecting it. On top of this, there’s a quick turnaround with a median response time of 1.9 hours and 42% of reviews happening within an hour. They’re not waiting three weeks for a review. The maintainers are cultivating a positive contributor experience through their responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iv2x52ng29yysttfl1e9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cognee lifecycle metrics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-this-tells-us-about-the-human-story&quot;&gt;What this tells us about the Human Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a maintainer, I’ve been in the situation where I don’t have the capacity to immediately respond to contributors, and sometimes they even have to wait weeks for my response. Obviously, this isn’t ideal. Usually, what happens is that the person has moved on, they may not respond at all, or they’re less likely to contribute again. What we see from cognee’s numbers is that they don’t have that same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone contributes to cognee, they aren’t left wondering whether or not their efforts are valued. They get fast enough feedback to stay engaged and iterate quickly. Their turnaround time for a review (1.6hrs) is a good way to encourage repeat contributors. Additionally, with a median merge time of 19.5 hours signals to contributors that their work has real and immediate impact. And they’re able to see their contributions available to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-collaboration-pattern&quot;&gt;The Collaboration Pattern&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at these metrics together, they’re telling a story of intentional collaboration design, a story that thinks about the contributor and maintainer experience. They’ve created systems and habits that make collaboration feel responsive and worthwhile. What’s telling about this data is also what’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; happening. We don’t see any pile-ups of unreviewed PRs. There are no huge gaps between approval and merge. There are no signs of contributor frustration or maintainer overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This collaboration story matters, not just to show that cognee looks like a good place to contribute, but because this can become a replicable story. Other projects can learn how to make collaboration feel good for the contributors involved. We can look at the data and the project and better understand what systems and practices created these patterns, and we can reach out to maintainers of projects we admire to ask: How do you build review workflows that are both thorough and fast? How do you maintain quality while staying responsive to community contributions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration quality doesn’t have to be something we guess at. We can learn more through the data and find projects that have the capacity to take contributions from community members. (And if you’re interested, collab.dev also has a nifty comparison tool. You can check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dub.sh/cognee-mem0&quot;&gt;mem0 v. cognee comparison&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bigger-picture-measuring-what-matters&quot;&gt;The Bigger Picture: Measuring What Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in a stage of open source where complex human dynamics determine whether open source projects succeed or fail. Collaboration metrics can help lead to better outcomes. When we measure collaboration effectively, we can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce contributor burnout by identifying overwhelmed maintainers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase successful first contributions by directing early contributors to responsive projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build more sustainable projects by understanding what healthy collaboration looks like&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create feedback loops that help projects improve their community practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In open source, we’ve proven that collaborative development can create incredible value, but we can’t ignore the sustainability challenges, maintainer burnout, and the difficulty of scaling human collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better visibility into collaboration patterns can help us to understand the future health of open source. We need tools that help us understand not just what code exists, but how effectively people work together to create and maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source has always been about people working together. Our metrics should reflect that meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breaking Bottlenecks: How Organizations Build Systems of Balanced Reciprocity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this third post of my series on giving and taking, we explore how to design systems that prevent burnout, distribute contributions, and transform individual reciprocity intelligence into organizational strength.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, when I lost my first developer job due to the pandemic, I was taking every interview I could get. One of them happened to be for a DevOps role at a well-known company. I didn’t even know what DevOps was at the time, but the hiring manager had reached out and asked me to interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first interview went well, and she invited me back for a second. The catch was that the second interview would only happen after I read &lt;em&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/em&gt; by Gene Kim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/em&gt; follows Maxine, a senior developer reassigned to a troubled initiative called the Phoenix Project. Through Maxine’s journey, we see how siloed knowledge, approval bottlenecks, and rigid processes destroy productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years later, as I think about reciprocity, I started thinking about this book again. It wasn’t just about technical problems. It was also about reciprocity. When knowledge, permissions, or capabilities concentrate in one person, that person becomes a constraint.
Here’s the paradox: The most generous givers often become the biggest bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I’ve been a bottleneck as the founder of the tech community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;. I was the one who knew how everything worked. I was the one who could answer questions. I was the one everyone came to when they needed help.
My desire to make sure I could take care of everyone’s needs created a system-wide constraint, and it was holding back the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research confirms this: teams with concentrated expertise are less resilient and adaptive than those with distributed knowledge systems. If your team depends on a few generous people to keep everything running, you’re building risk. The good news is that you can turn individual reciprocity into a scalable system for trust, flow, and contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-diminisher-to-multiplier&quot;&gt;From Diminisher to Multiplier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before looking at specific design principles, we need to shift our mental model. In &lt;em&gt;Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter&lt;/em&gt;, Liz Wiseman contrasts two leadership approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diminishers-who-drain-capability&quot;&gt;Diminishers (who drain capability):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hoard knowledge and decision-making&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solve problems for others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create dependency through “helping”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Become bottlenecks despite good intentions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multipliers-who-amplify-capability&quot;&gt;Multipliers (who amplify capability):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distribute knowledge and authority&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create challenges that build capability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish systems that enable independence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove themselves as bottlenecks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, “Wow, I know some really well-intentioned givers who fall into the category of diminisher.” Or maybe you’re that well-intentioned giver. When you solve problems for others instead of building their capability, you’re not giving sustainably. You’re creating an unhealthy reciprocity system where people remain dependent on your giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-trust-through-multiplier-principles&quot;&gt;Building Trust Through Multiplier Principles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the multiplier mindset as our foundation, we can see how sustainable reciprocity depends on trust. In &lt;em&gt;The Infinite Game&lt;/em&gt;, Simon Sinek emphasizes that trusting teams are a hallmark of enduring organizations. But trust is something that needs to be developed through measurable signals of care, consistency, and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reciprocity systems, that means not just measuring outcomes, but tracking patterns of help-giving, shared responsibility, and psychological safety. If your contributors know that support flows in multiple directions and that they won’t be punished for asking questions, they’re more likely to give back in ways that strengthen the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust becomes the infrastructure for reciprocity. Without it, your systems fall into suspicion, gatekeeping, and imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With trust and this multiplier mindset as our foundation, let’s explore five design principles for balanced reciprocity systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-design-principles-for-balanced-reciprocity&quot;&gt;Five Design Principles for Balanced Reciprocity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-principle-1-documentation-as-scaled-giving&quot;&gt;Design Principle #1: Documentation as Scaled Giving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a lot of givers, documentation can be a way to continue giving without requiring the emotional energy and time of 1:1 mentorship. This realization made a huge impact on empowering volunteers to take leadership roles at Virtual Coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation transforms individual expertise into organizational capability. Amazon’s documentation culture ensures that knowledge is accessible and decisions are transparent. Their “six-pager” narratives and strict documentation protocols mean that information doesn’t bottleneck with individuals, and that teammates are thinking deeply about the information that’s being presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;documentation-culture-implementation&quot;&gt;Documentation Culture Implementation:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create decision logs that explain not just what was decided, but why&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record short video walkthroughs of common processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish a “document first, then assist” culture where documentation is updated before individual help is given&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build knowledge bases with practical how-to guides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-principle-2-progressive-responsibility-frameworks&quot;&gt;Design Principle #2: Progressive Responsibility Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/em&gt; describes how Maxine creates a “dojo” environment where people learn by doing, gradually taking on more responsibility. Progressive responsibility creates clear pathways from dependence to contribution. Google’s “Googler to Googler” and “Globetrotters” programs rotate employees through different teams, giving them the opportunity to learn new skills and understand perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive responsibility allows for knowledge transfer at a manageable pace, and creates a culture of continuous learning and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive responsibility frameworks create clear pathways from dependence to contribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supported Phase&lt;/strong&gt; - High guidance, low autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative Phase&lt;/strong&gt; - Shared responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Phase&lt;/strong&gt; - Minimal guidance, high autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributory Phase&lt;/strong&gt; - Becoming a giver within the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, good open source contributor ladders do the same thing. At OpenSauced, one of our indicators of success was contributors moving through our repos, from their first contribution in our Learn track to working on our app. As they progressed, they learned more about our projects, our approach to open source, and our codebase, and, as a result, were more likely to support or mentor new contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementation-ideas&quot;&gt;Implementation Ideas:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create explicit onboarding levels with clear graduation criteria&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish “participation ladders” showing pathways to greater responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design contribution opportunities with varying levels of commitment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build “help tokens” systems where people earn the right to ask for help by helping others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-principle-3-flow-optimized-boundaries&quot;&gt;Design Principle #3: Flow-Optimized Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constant interruptions destroy flow and can lead to burnout. Spotify’s model of autonomous squads, organized into tribes and guilds, helps teams set boundaries while still cross-pollinating knowledge. Teams choose their own frameworks and manage their own workflows, reducing unnecessary interruptions and approval bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flow-optimized-boundaries-implementation-ideas&quot;&gt;Flow-optimized Boundaries Implementation Ideas:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish “office hours” for help-giving rather than allowing constant interruption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create asynchronous help systems (like dedicated Slack channels)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement “focus time” protocols where helping is intentionally paused&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build request queues rather than allowing direct interruptions
&lt;em&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/em&gt;’s second ideal—Focus, Flow, and Joy—applies directly to reciprocity systems. Constant interruptions to help others destroy flow, creating resentment even among the most generous givers. Creating flow-optimized boundaries guards against this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-principle-4-expertise-distribution-systems&quot;&gt;Design Principle #4: Expertise Distribution Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expertise needs to be distributed, not centralized, to maximize impact. Employee rotation programs at Google, General Electric, and the Mayo Clinic intentionally move people across roles and teams, making sure that no single person becomes a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expert-distribution-systems-implementation-ideas&quot;&gt;Expert Distribution Systems Implementation Ideas:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rotate responsibility for answering common questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement peer learning sessions where everyone teaches something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create expertise directories so people know who knows what
Establish skill-sharing programs where people exchange knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/em&gt;, the breakthrough comes when the team creates systems to share knowledge rather than centralizing it. When giving becomes part of the infrastructure rather than depending on specific individuals, reciprocity becomes sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-principle-5-balancing-feedback-mechanisms&quot;&gt;Design Principle #5: Balancing Feedback Mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without feedback loops, reciprocity systems drift toward imbalance. Regular retrospectives, community health surveys, and visualization of help patterns help organizations spot overburdened givers and chronic takers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;balancing-feedback-mechanisms-implementation-ideas&quot;&gt;Balancing Feedback Mechanisms Implementation Ideas:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conduct regular “reciprocity retrospectives” examining giving and taking patterns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create visualization tools showing help requests and contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement periodic capacity check-ins to identify overburdened givers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design gentle interventions for chronic taking patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balanced systems build trust through transparency. When contributors see that their feedback leads to visible changes, and that overburdened givers are protected, it signals that the organization is worthy of their continued investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sinek’s perspective underscores this: “The true value of a leader is not measured by the work they do. A leader’s value is measured by the work they inspire others to do.” Feedback systems signal to your people: We see you. We’re listening. We’re building something together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-principles-to-practice-overcoming-common-challenges&quot;&gt;From Principles to Practice: Overcoming Common Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these five principles in place, organizations often encounter obstacles when transforming their reciprocity systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge that resists documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some expertise is difficult to capture in writing or videos. When Maxine left her previous team in &lt;em&gt;The Unicorn Project&lt;/em&gt;, they struggled because her understanding of the system lived mostly in her head.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “this is how we’ve always done it” syndrome:&lt;/strong&gt; New systems often face resistance, especially from those who’ve benefited from the old ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Territorial thinking:&lt;/strong&gt;Teams and individuals sometimes protect their knowledge as a form of job security or status preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-experiments-with-big-impact&quot;&gt;Small Experiments with Big Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to overhaul your entire organization overnight. Consider starting with these manageable experiments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document your most-asked question.&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the one thing people constantly interrupt you to learn? Create a guide, record a walkthrough, or build a decision tree.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish dedicated help hours.&lt;/strong&gt; Protect your focus time while still being available by setting clear boundaries for when you’re available to give assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design one progressive challenge.&lt;/strong&gt; Identify someone who regularly asks for help, and create a graduated challenge that builds their capability instead of solving their problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run a simple reciprocity retrospective.&lt;/strong&gt; In your next team meeting, discuss: “Where are we seeing bottlenecks? Who seems overwhelmed with requests? How can we distribute knowledge better?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These small shifts can create ripple effects throughout your organization’s reciprocity culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reciprocity-culture-is-designed&quot;&gt;Reciprocity Culture is Designed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy reciprocity doesn’t happen by hoping the right people show up. It happens when organizations intentionally design feedback loops, distribute ownership, and normalize trust. That’s what I build,  whether it’s in open source, startups, or developer communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t equal giving at all times, but resilient systems that handle the natural ebb and flow of contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Wiseman says, “The goal isn’t to be the smartest person in the room-it’s to make everyone in the room smarter.” The same is true for giving: build systems where giving and receiving flow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations that design for reciprocity unlock scale. If you’re trying to build those systems—or recover from being the bottleneck—I’d love to hear how you’re approaching it.  How does your organization distribute knowledge and responsibility? What small experiment can you start this week?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reciprocity Intelligence: A Core Skill for Modern Work</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this second post of my series on giving and taking, I explore why reciprocity intelligence—the ability to navigate giving and receiving effectively—isn’t just nice to have anymore. If you missed the first post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bekahhw.com/company-culture-of-reciprocity&quot;&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-dont-talk-aboutreciprocity-intelligence-but-we-should&quot;&gt;We Don’t Talk about…Reciprocity Intelligence (but we should)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been drawn to the idea that core skills like empathy, communication, and resilience aren’t fixed skills, but learnable ones. You also might know them as “intelligences”: emotional intelligence, cultural intelligence, and even digital intelligence. Basically, they shape how we understand and navigate relationships and environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s one form of intelligence I don’t hear people talking about even though it defines how we operate in teams and communities: reciprocity intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity intelligence is the ability to move skillfully between giving and receiving. It’s knowing when to offer help, when to ask for it, and how to manage the emotions that come with both. It’s recognizing that generosity is situational and not a permanent identity. You’re not always a “giver” or a “taker.” You shift based on your capacity, your context, and your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that like any intelligence, reciprocity intelligence is something you can grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-research-behind-reciprocity-skills&quot;&gt;The Research Behind Reciprocity Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not likely referred to as reciprocity intelligence, the concept is gaining attention in research that is focused on its underlying skills. For example, Grant and Dutton (2012) found that when people are encouraged to think about times they gave or received help, they’re more likely to keep that generosity going at work. Even small reflection prompts can lead to more giving and collaboration on teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last twenty years, we’ve seen gratitude journaling become wildly popular. It should be no surprise that the focus is often on giving or receiving, and it has been proven to boost your mood and strengthen your relationships. These studies aren’t directly about reciprocity, but they show how simple reflection can spark more positive social behavior and help reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the neuroscience angle, Harbaugh and his team (2007) used brain scans to show that giving to others lights up the brain’s reward centers. Generosity feels good. Voluntary giving seems to bring the biggest reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this isn’t a single culture thing either. Cross-cultural research from Henrich et al. (2005) shows the idea of reciprocity shows up in cultures all over the world, and is practiced in many different ways. So what we can take away from this is that reciprocity is universal, but the actual skills to navigate it are shaped by culture and can be taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seasons-of-giving-and-taking&quot;&gt;Seasons of Giving and Taking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt; over the past five years, I’ve moved through distinct phases of giving and receiving. When I founded the community, I was primarily in a giving season and spent a lot of time organizing, mentoring, and speaking to early career developers. But eventually, I started to recognize the signs of burnout. This was also an opportunity to become a matcher or taker. I had to accept help, to allow others to contribute, to recognize that if I did it all on my own, I was on a fast-track to helping no one. I had to find that balance. And I needed to understand what that balance meant for me and take that knowledge and understanding with me to everything I did so I didn’t face burnout doing the things I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recognition, that we all move through seasons where we may give more or receive more, is central to reciprocity intelligence. The skill development means that you should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognize your current season without shame or guilt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate your capacity transparently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a “reciprocity bank” through consistent giving when able&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Withdraw thoughtfully when needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hidden-costs-of-false-giving&quot;&gt;The Hidden Costs of False Giving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of the most insidious challenges in workplace or community dynamics is what I call “false giving.” False giving is generosity theater. It looks like help, but it costs more than it contributes. And when it’s unchecked, it spreads by slowly draining the energy of the real contributors. Sometimes people “pass” as givers by volunteering. But when they deliver substandard work, it ultimately creates more work for others. What makes this particularly damaging is that it masquerades as contribution, offers support for the team/community, promises decreased workloads, etc. In reality, it takes value, time, and unplanned resources from your team. It becomes a virus that, if not addressed, can go deep into your veins and seriously damage your team’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on team dynamics and “social loafing” shows that when team members perceive others as not contributing, it can lead to frustration and resentment within the group (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ijip.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18.01.375.20241202.pdf&quot;&gt;Social Loafing and Its Effects on the Workplace&lt;/a&gt;).Teams generally function better and show more mutual respect when members are honest about their limitations and boundaries (for reference, check out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness&quot;&gt;Understand team
effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vantagecircle.com/en/blog/team-dynamics/&quot;&gt;Team Dynamics: The Backbone of Effective Collaboration&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-the-hard-conversations&quot;&gt;Have the Hard Conversations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge proponent of having hard conversations when you need to, and this especially applies to team dynamics. In the first year of Virtual Coffee, we read &lt;em&gt;Radical Candor&lt;/em&gt;, and it opened my mind to understand the disservice you do when you don’t give people honest and candid feedback. The fact is, when someone consistently takes without investing, it burns people out and damages relationships, teams, and communities. I’ve witnessed firsthand how just one or two chronic takers can deplete an entire team’s motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity intelligence includes the ability to address imbalances directly. This is why it’s important to be able to give to others by having honest conversations about their impact. With this approach, you can better understand how to have that conversation in a way that makes clear what the boundaries of giving and taking are. Early conflict resolution can address giving and taking imbalances that create healthier team dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developing-your-reciprocity-intelligence&quot;&gt;Developing Your Reciprocity Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that you can grow in reciprocity intelligence. That’s not helpful unless you know how. Based on both research and experience, here are some practical steps I think you can use to develop your reciprocity intelligence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practice-reciprocity-awareness&quot;&gt;Practice Reciprocity Awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Track your giving and taking behaviors across different relationships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notice which interactions energize versus deplete you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify your “giving strengths” (the types of contribution that come naturally).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, you might like taking someone a meal after they’ve had a child, but feel depleted when you have to organize three weeks’ worth of meals for them. Or maybe you enjoy pair programming with a junior developer, but creating a mentorship plan for junior developers felt exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being aware can help you restructure your giving to focus on your strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-recovery-into-giving&quot;&gt;Build Recovery into Giving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set boundaries around your giving to prevent burnout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schedule recovery time after intensive giving periods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop rituals that help you recharge your “giving battery”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might find that you need a 2-for-1 giving rule, where for every two giving activities you might need a recovery activity (reading, taking a walk, an evening without community responsibilities, etc.). Identify necessary boundaries to prevent burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-to-receive-gracefully&quot;&gt;Learn to Receive Gracefully&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practice accepting help without feeling diminished&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Express specific appreciation for support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognize that allowing others to give benefits them too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to practice saying “thank you,” instead of “I got this.” It’s also worth noting that when you allow others to help you, they might find joy in helping. You’re empowering them to be a giver in a way that energizes them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communicate-your-capacity&quot;&gt;Communicate Your Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be transparent about your current giving capacity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signal shifting capacity before reaching burnout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frame limitations as temporary seasons rather than permanent states&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be specific about what you can and cannot handle so people don’t have to guess. You don’t have to offer explanations, but you do have to share that you need help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A low-level way to communicate capacity is to implement a simple traffic light system: green means I have capacity to help, yellow means I’m at my limit but can handle quick questions or issues, and red means I need to focus on existing commitments or I’m at capacity. Visual cues help set expectations without requiring constant explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invest-in-reciprocity-education&quot;&gt;Invest in Reciprocity Education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide team training on healthy giving and receiving (this also helps to set expectations)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discuss reciprocity norms explicitly in your organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognize and celebrate balanced contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I’ve seen givers doing the majority of giving year after year after year until they burnout in communities, as volunteers, on teams, and really any aspect of life. If you’re running a team, think about offering onboarding about reciprocity patterns or having quarterly retros that include a reciprocity patterns that allow for better knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you cultivate reciprocity intelligence experience, you can lower burnout rates, create a more equitable distribution of effort, allow for stronger team cohesion, encourage greater innovation through psychological safety, and see a higher retention rate of top talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-personal-reflection&quot;&gt;A Personal Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be hard as a giver to not give, especially if you’re used to giving to others who normally reciprocate. You want to believe everyone will be willing to give back, to send ripples out into the world, but that’s not always the case. The most sustainable communities and teams are those where reciprocity intelligence is valued as a core skill and where members understand the rhythm of giving and receiving that sustains us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the next post in this series, we’ll explore how to design systems and processes that naturally encourage balanced reciprocity rather than enabling chronic taking or burning out your most generous team or community members.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Giving-Resilience Balance: Beyond Givers and Takers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In today’s workplace, we need both a culture of contribution and the personal strength to thrive independently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read Adam Grant’s “Give and Take.” His framework of givers, takers, and matchers gave really great insight into professional and community interactions. As I reflected on my own experiences, I thought that we might be creating systems that unintentionally cultivate dependency rather than balanced reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant’s research shows that givers often succeed in the long run, but only when they give strategically. What does a balanced approach looks like, then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-binary-thinking&quot;&gt;Beyond Binary Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation around giving and taking often falls into an oversimplified binary: selfless contributors versus selfish extractors. Although this might be helpful in understanding, we all know that reality is more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we examine the complexity, some of the things we need to consider are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt; - When is giving appropriate versus when is self-reliance necessary?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill development&lt;/strong&gt; - How do we build both generosity and resilience simultaneously?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems design&lt;/strong&gt; - How can organizations encourage healthy giving without creating dependency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-support-resilience-matrix&quot;&gt;The Support-Resilience Matrix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often think about professional development along two axes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Low Resilience&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;High Resilience&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Struggle Zone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Rugged Individualism&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Dependency Zone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Thriving Zone&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best results happen in the “Thriving Zone,” where people have support when they need it and the confidence to stand on their own when they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cultivating-balanced-contributors&quot;&gt;Cultivating Balanced Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop professionals or community members who thrive in this balanced space, we need approaches that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach effective help-seeking&lt;/strong&gt; - The ability to ask for appropriate support rather than expecting or demanding it. For example, a junior developer should learn to ask targeted questions &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; attempting a solution, instead of waiting passively, demanding immediate answers, or asking general questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why it matters&lt;/em&gt;: This builds confidence, respect among peers, and a culture of learning and independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build progressive challenges&lt;/strong&gt; - Gradually decreasing direct support as competence grows. For example, a new team member may start with detailed tickets and then gradually move to leading small features or mentoring others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why it matters&lt;/em&gt;: Team members can grow without being overwhelmed, with support being scaled back as skills improve. That also allows the support team to budget their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize strategic giving&lt;/strong&gt; - Understanding when and how to contribute without burning out. This is especially useful in situations where more senior team members also act as mentors. For example, a senior engineer may avoid burnout by blocking out time weekly for mentorship and not compromising by going over or outside that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why it matters&lt;/em&gt;: Contributions are more likely to be sustainable and impactful. This is key to avoid exhaustion or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop reciprocity intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; - The awareness of give-take dynamics and how to navigate them strategically.  For example, if a team member notices they’ve been receiving more help than giving, they could initiate a peer support circle to balance the dynamic or look at new team/community members and offer to support them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why it matters&lt;/em&gt;: Being aware of giving and receiving patterns helps build trust, equity, and stronger team relationships over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience building community and being on teams, the most impactful contributors weren’t necessarily “natural givers.” What set them apart was a thoughtful, strategic approach to contribution. They navigated the balance between support and self-reliance with intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reimagining-professional-development&quot;&gt;Reimagining Professional Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a balanced perspective, we need to reimagine how we approach professional development:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentorship programs&lt;/strong&gt; should gradually transition from high-support to high-autonomy. This requires a deliberate development of mentorship, expectation setting, and growth monitoring. The goal should be to equip mentees to eventually lead, support others, and navigate challenges on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback systems&lt;/strong&gt; that acknowledge contribution while encouraging independence. For example, instead of only praising helpfulness, celebrate moments when someone solved a complex issue independently or helped others develop their own solutions. This helps shift the focus from being the hero to building group resilience and problem-solving abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team structures&lt;/strong&gt; that rotate giving and receiving roles. No one should always be the helper or the one receiving support. When everyone has the opportunity to contribute and to learn, we encourage empathy, shared responsibility, and prevent burnout or stagnation. It’s worth noting that everyone has different strengths, so considering each person’s individual strengths may impact how you rotate roles or what roles people take on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural norms&lt;/strong&gt; that celebrate both generosity and self-reliance. Leaders set the tone for the whole company, which means when they model healthy boundaries, thoughtful help-seeking, and strategic support, it gives permission for others to do the same. This top-down modeling is necessary for making balance a norm rather than an exception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither pure self-reliance nor complete dependency serves us well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By cultivating both giving cultures and personal resilience, we create the conditions for sustainable success—for individuals, teams, and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in a series exploring the balance between support and resilience in modern professional environments. Next week, I’ll dive deeper into practical strategies for developing “reciprocity intelligence” in yourself and your team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been following AI developments at all over the last year, I’m sure you heard about how autonomous AI agents were the next big thing that was going to change the landscape. You might have also heard names like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and CAMEL AI. These agents could loop through tasks, reflect, plan, and even decide which tools to use. It felt a little like magic or sci fi to be able to give them a goal and watch them figure things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’ve still been following along the AI train, you’ve probably started hearing about the next big thing called Model Context Protocol, or MCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this going to overtake agents for the next big thing? How are they different than agents? This 101 post should give you a little more insight into agents and MCP and understand how they’ll continue to impact the AI landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intern-vs-assembly-line-a-metaphor&quot;&gt;Intern vs Assembly Line: A Metaphor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are a lot of people talking about both of these, there’s no shortage of information, but let’s try to think of it in a practical way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agents are like highly capable assistants that can independently complete complex tasks when given clear roles, goals, and the right tools. Earlier versions felt like handing a vague task to a junior intern. Today’s agents like those built with CrewAI or LangGraph can function more like specialized team members in a workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MCP are like giving a trained operator access to a tightly organized set of APIs and tools, with a clear understanding of how to use them. The system is grounded, predictable, and effective because it follows a well-defined communication protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-agents&quot;&gt;What Are Agents?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous AI agents are systems that use AI to think, plan, and take actions on their own. They often use tools, remember what they’ve done, and reflect on their results to improve as they go. They typically use large language models (LLMs) to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agent-strengths&quot;&gt;Agent Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great for exploration, ideation, and R&amp;amp;D&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can autonomously coordinate multiple tools and tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modern frameworks (e.g. CrewAI) support reliable, role-based behavior and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weaknesses&quot;&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Still require clear prompts and setup to be effective&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debugging and transparency can be tricky&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Costly when not tightly scoped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;real-use-case-research-automation&quot;&gt;Real Use Case: Research Automation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some developers have used agents to research new topics by instructing them to search the web, summarize sources, and provide reports. If you’re like me, you’ve probably done this and found that although the agent is confident, they’re often unreliable and provide outdated or even hallucinated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;agent-example-autogpt-for-seo-content-research&quot;&gt;Agent Example: AutoGPT for SEO Content Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say a starup wants to generate a blog content plan based on competitor analysis and trending keywords. Instead of using a single, looping agent like AutoGPT, they use CrewAI to assign specific roles to multiple agents in a structured workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DataFetcher Agent: Crawls top competitor blogs and pulls content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;KeywordAnalyzer Agent: Extracts trending SEO keywords from the collected content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ContentStrategist Agent: Generates 10 article ideas tailored to the startup’s niche.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system coordinates their work, uses APIs for data gathering, ensures reliable outputs, and assembles the results in a structured format—like a JSON file or database entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this still qualify as an agent-based approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each agent has a defined role but operates autonomously within that scope.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agents decide how to accomplish their task using available tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system runs without step-by-step user intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s modular, adaptable, and can evolve with more or fewer agents as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This structured take on agents is more reliable than early implementations like AutoGPT, but still retains the autonomy and flexibility that define agent-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-mcp&quot;&gt;What Are MCP?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model Context Protocols (MCP) are standards that help AI models connect to real tools, data, and APIs in a reliable way. Instead of guessing, the model knows what tools it can use, what kind of data to expect, and how to respond with clean, structured output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCP are all about giving the model clear rules for how to work with real-world systems and information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths&quot;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predictable and testable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grounded in real-time or structured data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designed for reliability in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weaknesses-1&quot;&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less flexible in ambiguous scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relies on well-defined schemas and system design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;real-use-case-connecting-models-to-live-apis&quot;&gt;Real Use Case: Connecting Models to Live APIs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With MCP, a model can understand how to query an external weather API, get user-specific account info, or return a JSON object for further processing without the unpredictability of hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mcp-example-anthropics-model-context-protocol-for-travel-booking&quot;&gt;MCP Example: Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol for Travel Booking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say a travel app startup wants users to get real-time booking options through natural language without risking unreliable results. They use Claude with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect structured tools like a flight search API and hotel database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The developer registers each tool with clear metadata: what it does, what input it expects, and what output it returns (FlightSearch, HotelAvailability, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Claude knows exactly how to interact with each tool without guesswork or hallucination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;` User: “Find me a flight to Berlin next Friday and a hotel under $200 near Alexanderplatz.”`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude parses the input, calls the right APIs, and responds with structured, programmatic output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this an MCP approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The model operates within a predefined protocol and toolset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It doesn’t choose its own path by following clear, reliable instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The results are testable, repeatable, and safe for production environments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s built for structure and reliability, not for exploring open-ended tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes MCP ideal for enterprise-scale use cases where accuracy, consistency, and control are more important than creative autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agents-vs-mcp-side-by-side&quot;&gt;Agents vs MCP: Side-by-Side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Agents&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;MCP (Model Context Protocols)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Autonomy&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Low (Structured)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Predictability&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Debuggability&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Poor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Strong&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Best Use Case&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Exploration, ideation&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Live data access, production workflows&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Hallucination Risk&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cost Efficiency&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;High (due to fewer missteps)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Agents today can use structured tools too—autonomy here refers to their ability to decide how and when to use them, versus MCP’s pre-defined pathways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shift-from-agents-to-mcp&quot;&gt;The Shift from Agents to MCP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that agents have allowed us to do work faster and more efficiently, but most developers want tools that are reliable, testable, and scalable. MCP offer more of that structure by allowing models to function more like connected services. Because of this, they can access and return real information instead of improvising answers. MCP aren’t going to cause the death of agents, but we can think of it like maturing in the process of using language models in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-should-i-use-an-agent-or-model-context-protocol-mcp&quot;&gt;Bonus: Should I Use an Agent or Model Context Protocol (MCP)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very simiplified way to look at it, but hopefully if you’re still trying to figure this out, you might find some insight in the questions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your goal quick experimentation or creative exploration?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;✅ Yes → &lt;strong&gt;Use an Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;❌ No → Next question&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this going into a production system?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;✅ Yes → &lt;strong&gt;Use MCP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;❌ No → Next question&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you need precise control over tool usage and structured output (like JSON or API calls)?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;✅ Yes → &lt;strong&gt;Use MCP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;❌ No → &lt;strong&gt;Use an Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Situation&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Use Agent&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Use MCP&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Prototyping / R&amp;amp;D&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Needs structured, reliable output&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Calling multiple real-world APIs&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;You want fast, creative ideas&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Building a user-facing feature&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

        <title>Measuring the Impact of Developer Content: Metrics That Matter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was chatting with a Developer Advocate at Gitbook, and he asked me what metrics we looked at for docs at OpenSauced. The honest answer is that we didn’t have KPIs or OKRs or metrics that determined our success. Ultimately, our success was based on users being able to use the software and understand the value in the data we were exposing. Now, that doesn’t mean that I didn’t measure anything. It just means that we weren’t building dashboards to track progress. Ultimately, the metrics will depend on your team’s goals, but here are some of the things I think are valuable in identifying whether or not the docs I’m working on are successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-vanity-metrics-the-true-impact-of-developer-content&quot;&gt;Beyond Vanity Metrics: The True Impact of Developer Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional content metrics like page views and social shares can be useful, but they tell an incomplete story. There are three dimensions to Developer Content Value that I like to think of as we connect documentation to business outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-engagement-quality-of-interaction&quot;&gt;1. Engagement: Quality of Interaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface-level engagement metrics tell you if developers are finding your content, but deeper metrics will show you if they’re actually succeeding with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basic-metrics&quot;&gt;Basic Metrics:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Page views&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average time on page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bounce rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;advanced-metrics&quot;&gt;Advanced Metrics:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content completion rates: What percentage of developers complete multi-step tutorials?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code example copy events: How often do developers copy sample code (indicates intent to implement)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation-to-implementation time: How quickly do developers move from reading docs to successful implementation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return visit patterns: How frequently do developers reference the same documentation (may indicate confusion or high value)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-support-deflection-reducing-operational-costs&quot;&gt;2. Support Deflection: Reducing Operational Costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-crafted developer content should impact support volume and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-metrics&quot;&gt;Key Metrics:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support ticket reduction: Decrease in tickets related to documented topics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Question sophistication: Shift from basic “how to” questions to more advanced inquiries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-service resolution rates: Percentage of developers who resolve issues through documentation rather than support channels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation referrals: How often support agents can resolve issues by linking to existing documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-product-adoption-driving-business-outcomes&quot;&gt;3. Product Adoption: Driving Business Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, developer content should allow for successful product adoption and usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-metrics-1&quot;&gt;Key Metrics:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation-influenced conversion: Conversion rates for users who engage with documentation vs. those who don’t&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature adoption correlation: Relationship between documentation engagement and feature usage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time-to-value: How quickly new developers reach their first success milestone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retention impact: Differences in retention between developers who use documentation vs. those who don’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation Instrumentation
To gather meaningful data, your documentation needs appropriate tracking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Event-based analytics: Track specific interactions beyond page views (code copying, example expansion, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation-to-product pathing: Follow user journeys from documentation to product implementation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feedback mechanisms: Implement contextual feedback options ( “Was this helpful?” with follow-up options)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search analytics: Track what developers search for, what they find, and what they do next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-data-sources&quot;&gt;Connecting Data Sources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand whether or not your documentation is successful, you should consider how to connect it to other systems you’re tracking. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support ticket integration: Tag tickets with related documentation to identify gaps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product usage correlation: Connect documentation engagement with feature adoption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer journey mapping: Track developer progression from documentation to implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every team has the resources for comprehensive analytics, but you can start with minimal investment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement basic document instrumentation
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add “Was this helpful?” widgets to key pages&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Track code copying events&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Monitor documentation search queries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sample qualitative data
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Review a subset of support tickets weekly to identify documentation gaps&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Conduct monthly documentation interviews with developers&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add optional exit surveys when developers leave documentation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use proxy metrics
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Monitor support volume for topics with new/updated documentation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Track time spent in documentation vs. successful API calls&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Compare onboarding completion rates before and after documentation changes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-contributor-journey-metrics&quot;&gt;The Contributor Journey Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For open source projects, documentation is both an onboarding tool and a contributor pipeline. At OpenSauced, we partially looked at our documentation effectiveness through the “contribution ladder” metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First-time contributor conversion: Percentage of documentation readers who make their first contribution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contributor retention: Rate at which contributors return to make additional contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contribution progression: Movement of contributors through increasingly complex contribution types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At OpenSauced, we structured our documentation to create a clear progression path for contributors. New community members typically followed this journey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education path: Learning about open source and its purpose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation contributions: Making their first contributions by improving our docs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;App contributions: Eventually contributing to the core application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at this ladder, we can also see it from this perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Awareness → Interest: How many people who discovered the project engaged with documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest → First Contribution: Conversion rate from students to first-time contributors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First Contribution → Repeat Contribution: Retention rate of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat → Core Contributor: Progression rate to becoming regular contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;last-thoughts&quot;&gt;Last Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective measurement isn’t about proving documentation’s worth in the abstract. You have to try to connect content directly to the metrics that matter to your organization. Whether that’s reducing support costs, accelerating adoption, or improving developer satisfaction, the right metrics framework can change the perception and value of your documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Common Pitfalls in Developer Content: The 7 Deadly Sins of Developer Documentation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://bekahhw.com/Creating-Content-Developers-Love&quot;&gt;Content Developers Love&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s natural to follow that with some of the places where developer content goes wrong. It’s usually not one thing that causes documentation to go wrong; it can be death by a thousand papercuts. Learning how to recognize some of the common problems can keep your writing on track or help you catch it before the problem becomes too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-outdated-information-the-trust-killer&quot;&gt;1. Outdated Information: The Trust Killer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s only one path that outdated documentation leads to: frustration. Maintaining a large documentation base can be challenging to keep up, especially if there isn’t clear communication with engineering teams, but every effort should be made to keep documentation up to date with the current version of your product. Outdated documentation will decrease trust with your users, and that’s hard to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement a systematic content review process tied to your release cycle. As part of this, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Version tag all code examples&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automate testing of any documentation code samples&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform quarterly technical reviews of developer-facing content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add Changelog links embedded within documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-missing-prerequisites-the-silent-blocker&quot;&gt;2. Missing Prerequisites: The Silent Blocker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any content that assumes knowledge or setup that developers don’t have creates immediate friction. What’s obvious to you may be a complete mystery to someone new to your ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a “Before You Begin” checklist at the start of each tutorial&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clearly state prerequisites at the beginning of each piece of content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide links to resources that help developers meet these prerequisites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test your content with developers who are new to your product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways I like to think about approaching documentation is as “User 0”, meaning I’m the first person to go through the process, encounter the pitfalls, and document not just what works, but what didn’t, so that others don’t have to. You have to think like a user who’s engaging with the documentation for the first time, making sure the experience is intuitive, clear, and kind to anyone coming in fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-undisclosed-limitations-the-hidden-trap&quot;&gt;3. Undisclosed Limitations: The Hidden Trap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers appreciate honesty about what your solution can’t do as much as clarity about what it can do. Nobody wants to feel “tricked” into thinking they can do something with your product only to find out that it can’t do that, takes substantial investment to implement a workaround, or it’s somewhere down the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create dedicated “Limitations” or “Considerations” sections&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be transparent about edge cases and known issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer workarounds when possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update limitation documentation as your product evolves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-neglecting-the-why-the-context-gap&quot;&gt;4. Neglecting the “Why”: The Context Gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers aren’t just implementing solutions, they’re making architectural decisions. They need to understand the reasoning behind recommendations to adapt them appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain the rationale behind design patterns or recommended approaches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide context for best practices rather than just stating them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share trade-offs considered when making architectural recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-tutorial-cliffs-the-abandonment-point&quot;&gt;5. Tutorial Cliffs: The Abandonment Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest gaps I’ve seen is that there’s a lot of great beginner (101-level) content and then a sharp jump to advanced (400-level) documentation. That creates a “tutorial cliff,” or a sudden drop in learning support.  Part of creating a good content library means filling in those gaps, including 100, 200, 300, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 400 level content to support a variety of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Map your content to a complete developer journey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create explicit “next steps” at the end of introductory content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build “intermediate” content that bridges tutorials and reference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide “recipe” style content for common implementation patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-poor-organization-the-structure-problem&quot;&gt;6. Poor Organization: The Structure Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have the best, most comprehensive documentation, but if it’s poorly organized, developers won’t be able to use it effectively and are more likely to choose an alternative due to frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organize content by both task and concept (dual navigation)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create clear hierarchies with consistent depth and breadth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use progressive disclosure (show users only the most essential information, but allow them to access more complex or detailed information through deliberate interaction like clicking, expanding, etc.) to prevent overwhelming users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement topic relationships and “see also” sections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-missing-troubleshooting-guidance-the-dead-end-dilemma&quot;&gt;7. Missing Troubleshooting Guidance: The Dead-End Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When documentation only covers the happy path and doesn’t address common errors or problems, developers hit roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incorporate error message explanations directly in documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create dedicated troubleshooting sections for common failure points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Document known edge cases and their workarounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include debugging strategies specific to your platform&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analyze support tickets to identify and document recurring issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;turning-pitfalls-into-opportunities&quot;&gt;Turning Pitfalls into Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these mistakes represents an opportunity to improve the developer experience. The good news? Most companies are making at least some of these errors, creating a competitive advantage for those who address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-actionable-approach-to-improvement&quot;&gt;An Actionable Approach to Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to improve your developer content, start with this simple process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit:&lt;/strong&gt; Evaluate your current content against the pitfalls outlined above&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify the top 2-3 issues causing the most friction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement:&lt;/strong&gt; Make targeted improvements to address these specific pitfalls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure:&lt;/strong&gt; Track the impact of your changes on developer satisfaction and product adoption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterate:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuously refine based on feedback and changing needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;excellence-through-empathy&quot;&gt;Excellence Through Empathy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, avoiding these pitfalls requires genuine empathy for your developer audience. By understanding their needs, frustrations, and workflows, you can create content that not only avoids common problems but also empowers developers to succeed with your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great developer documentation is both about technical accuracy and creating an experience that respects developers’ time, intelligence, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding Multiple Authors to my Astro Writing Blog: A Technical Walkthrough</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, my brothers and I wrote our first novel together (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dub.sh/b4c-astro&quot;&gt;The Battle for Christmas: Reign of the Nutcrackers&lt;/a&gt;). That experience inspired us to continue writing together, starting with a monthly newsletter with short stories. At this point, we decided we wanted a website. We had been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://kit.com/&quot;&gt;Kit&lt;/a&gt; to send emails, and we liked that functionality, but as our writing resumes grow, we also wanted to have a place where people could see all of our work, and this is where our Astro site came in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve been interested in checking out Astro for a while, but when I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://luciacerchie.dev/&quot;&gt;Lucia Cerchie’s blog&lt;/a&gt; I fell in love with the Astro template (by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/Charca&quot;&gt;Maxi Ferreira&lt;/a&gt;) she used. I decided to start there, but since this was a blog for me and both of my brothers, I would need to add functionality for multiple authors. Here’s how I did that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-the-hard-way-my-journey-to-astro-content-collections&quot;&gt;Learning the Hard Way: My Journey to Astro Content Collections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into it, I need to acknowledge that I started with a mistake. I did the thing I say not to do and I started without fully reading the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first added multiple author functionality, I created a simple JavaScript file to manage author data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;BekahHW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;BekahHW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bekah grew up in a storytelling-rich environment with her brothers...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/assets/bhw_headshot.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Josh Hawrot is married to his inspiring wife Cruz...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/assets/josh.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...another author&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I connected this to my blog posts using dynamic routes. Everything worked, and I didn’t think twice about it. And then a couple of days later, I was looking at Astro documentation, when I had my facepalm moment: the documentation clearly outlined a more structured, type-safe approach using collections that would make my content more maintainable and scalable. It’s worth noting that I was also using an older version of Astro, and updating to 5.5.3 gave me more functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From their docs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Content collections are the best way to manage sets of content in any Astro project. Collections help to organize and query your documents, enable Intellisense and type checking in your editor, and provide automatic TypeScript type-safety for all of your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was exactly what I had needed, and I missed it because I hadn’t spent enough time in the docs. Let’s just say this is one of those lessons you remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I had &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; working though, so why did I need to change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-needed-to-change&quot;&gt;Why I Needed to Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original approach worked, but switching to Astro’s Content Collections API provided significant benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schema validation&lt;/strong&gt;: Content collections automatically validate my data structure, preventing errors before they happen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TypeScript integration&lt;/strong&gt;: I get autocompletion and type checking when working with author and blog data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured content&lt;/strong&gt;: All data follows a consistent format, making it easier to maintain and extend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplified queries&lt;/strong&gt;: The Collections API provides built-in methods for accessing content, eliminating custom filtering code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance improvements&lt;/strong&gt;: Astro 5’s Content Layer API is specifically optimized for efficiency and scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, with Astro 5’s reference system, I can establish proper relationships between content types. For example, I can directly reference an author from a blog post using reference(“authors”) in the schema, which creates a clean, maintainable connection between content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;migrating-to-astro-content-collections&quot;&gt;Migrating to Astro Content Collections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting Up the Content Directory
First, I created the proper content directory structure:
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/
├── content/
│   ├── config.ts  &amp;lt;- Configuration for all collections
│   ├── authors/
│   │   ├── Bekah.md
│   │   ├── Josh.md
│   │   └── Zach.md
│   └── blog/
│       └── my-blog-posts.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defining Content Schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of content collections is the schema definition, which makes sure all your content follows a consistent structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// src/content/config.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;defineCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;astro:content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;glob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;astro/loaders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Define the schema for the authors collection&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;defineCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;glob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;**/*.md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;./src/content/authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Define the schema for the blog collection&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;defineCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;glob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;**/*.md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;./src/content/blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Export the collections&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Converting Author Data to Individual Files
I converted each author from my JS object to individual Markdown files:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Bekah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;grew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;storytelling-rich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;brothers,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;imagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;were&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;central&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;life...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixing Author Name Capitalization in the Blog List View&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue I ran into was that the author name was appearing in all lowercase in the blog list view (/blog/). This happened because I was using the author ID (which is derived from filenames and always lowercase) instead of their actual name from the frontmatter. Here’s how I updated that in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/pages/index.astro&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Fetch all author entries&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authorEntries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAuthorName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authorId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authorEntries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authorId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authorId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Fallback to ID if author not found&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BaseLayout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;permalink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;permalink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating Templates to Use Content Collections
Next, I refactored my blog and author pages to use the Content Collections API:
```js
—
// src/pages/blog/[slug].astro
import BaseLayout from ‘../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro’;
import Bio from ‘../../components/Bio.astro’;
import { getCollection, getEntry, render } from ‘astro:content’;
import ShareButtons from ‘../../components/ShareButtons.astro’;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;export async function getStaticPaths() {
try {
    const blogEntries = await getCollection(‘blog’);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Create routes using entry ID
return blogEntries.map(post =&amp;gt; {
  console.log(`Creating route for ${post.id}`);
  return {
    params: { slug: post.id },
    props: { entryId: post.id },  // Just pass the ID
  };
});   } catch (error) {
console.error(&quot;Error in getStaticPaths:&quot;, error);
return [];   } }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Get blog post data from props
const { entryId } = Astro.props;
const entry = await getEntry(‘blog’, entryId);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if (!entry) {
  return Astro.redirect(‘/404’);

&lt;p&gt;// Render the content
const { Content } = await render(entry);
const allAuthors = await getCollection(‘authors’);

  try {

&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{entry.data.publishDate} ~ {entry.data.readingTime}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{entry.data.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;article class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Content /&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    {author &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (
      &lt;div class=&quot;author-bio&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;
        &amp;lt;Bio 
          name={author.data.name}
          bio={author.data.bio}
          avatar={author.data.avatar}
        /&amp;gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )}
    
    &amp;lt;ShareButtons title={entry.data.title} permalink={permalink} /&amp;gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/BaseLayout&amp;gt;
```
There are two things that I wanted to implement while working on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the bottom of every short story, you see the author and their bio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you click an author from the list view, you are taken to their page with links to all of their works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of those are fully functional on the site now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I learned a lot during this project, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the documentation first: So much time and effort could have been saved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the platform’s built-in features: Modern frameworks like Astro provide powerful tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be willing to refactor: Sometimes you need to accept you’ve taken the wrong approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still things that I need to work on for the site. The next priority is to improve the mobile view and responsiveness, but I’m happy to have it working. We already have two of our short stories up there attributed to the correct authors, and in a couple of weeks mine will be there too. You can check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dub.sh/siblings-write&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; now!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating Content Developers Love: A Guide to Developer Experience (DX) Content</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I’ve been in the middle of conversations about whether or not DevRel belongs in marketing. At the end of the day, I don’t know that it matters if you understand developers. One of the biggest pain points I’ve seen from marketing teams is understanding how to talk to developers, because, as we all know, developers are highly sensitive to feeling like they’ve been “marketed to.” What that really means is that they have high standards for the content they consume. Developers want to know that you understand the information. They want precision, depth, and utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I saw a tweet from a team lead at a large company who said that they were working on choosing a new package for a feature they were working on. The number one reason they passed on some packages? Poor documentation and resources. Developers need to be able to understand how to use software so they can be effective as they create theirs. As I dive deeper into content creation targeting developers, I’m trying to find more ways to distill effective ways of presenting that content. In this post, I’m sharing how to present technical content to a technical audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-developer-mindset&quot;&gt;Understanding the Developer Mindset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the main skill a developer has is problem-solving. That’s because that’s what they do. Most of them aren’t asking the question, “What does your product do?” They’re asking, “How can this product help me to solve my current challenge?” When you create content that recognizes that ask,  you’re building credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is never an end to the challenges developers have to solve. That’s why it’s important to value their time. You need to get to the point, create a scannable and well-structured hierarchy, and provide complete solutions without unnecessary stops. As part of that, you need to understand that they’re likely also looking for technical depth. They want the authors to understand not just how to implement something, but also why it needs to be implemented. If there are limitations, admit them. Don’t try to hide them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-clear-framework-for-developer-content&quot;&gt;The CLEAR framework for Developer Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways that you can structure effective content, but sometimes it’s nice to have a framework to maintain consistency. Here are some takeaways from my experiences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c---code-first-examples&quot;&gt;C - Code-First Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working code clearly communicates credibility to your audience. Ways to incorporate this could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Functional code examples that could be copied and pasted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explanations that followed the code, not preceded it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Real-world scenarios rather than contrived examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripe is one of those companies that people point to as the standard for documentation. Their documentation leads with code examples, demonstrating both how the API works and how it responds to different inputs as well as common use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Always test your code examples in an isolated environment before publishing. Nothing undermines credibility faster than sample code that doesn’t work as described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;l---layered-complexity&quot;&gt;L - Layered Complexity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great developer content acknowledges different knowledge levels by layering information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entry points for new users and learners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deeper technical details for experienced users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced use cases and optimizations for experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twilio’s documentation does this exceptionally well, offering quick starts for beginners alongside detailed API references and more advanced tutorials for complex implementation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;e---ecosystem-awareness&quot;&gt;E - Ecosystem Awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great Developer Experience content acknowledges the broader ecosystem in which your product operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vercel’s Next.js documentation excels here, providing guidance on how Next.js interacts with various styling solutions, deployment platforms, and state management libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Create integration guides for popular tools in your ecosystem. These high-value resources address real workflow challenges and demonstrate your understanding of the developer’s complete environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a---accessible-terminology&quot;&gt;A - Accessible Terminology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technical depth is important, you should avoid unnecessary jargon or marketing speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good developer content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defines terms clearly upon first use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoids acronyms without explanation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses consistent terminology throughout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When documenting complex concepts, I’ve found that starting with an analogy that relates to widely understood programming concepts can be useful. From there, you can transition to more specific terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;r---reproducible-workflows&quot;&gt;R - Reproducible Workflows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers need to understand not just isolated features but complete workflows. Content that connects the dots and shows how components work together in a reproducible process is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub’s documentation on GitHub Actions demonstrates this principle well, walking developers through complete CI/CD workflows rather than just explaining individual actions in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Structure tutorials as complete journeys with clear starting conditions and defined outcomes. Make sure developers can reproduce your examples with minimal setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developer-content-as-a-product&quot;&gt;Developer Content as a Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most successful companies treat developer content not as a marketing afterthought but as a product in itself that’s designed with specific user needs in mind, measured by meaningful metrics, and continuously improved based on feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers are among the most demanding content consumers, but also the most loyal when their needs are genuinely met. Great developer content doesn’t just support your product, it becomes one of your most valuable assets.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Content Strategy for Startups: Storytelling as a Growth Driver</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It started with an air mattress on the floor of a San Francisco apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia couldn’t afford their rent in 2007, they purchased three air mattresses and created a simple WordPress website called “Air Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast,” renting the mattresses during a design conference when the hotels were sold out. That isn’t just the origin story of a company that would eventually be valued at over $100 billion. It’s a perfect example of how a compelling origin story can become a powerful asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most successful startups aren’t just building products; they’re telling stories that resonate, inspire, and drive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-features-why-stories-drive-startup-growth&quot;&gt;Beyond Features: Why Stories Drive Startup Growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I taught college English for ten years before coming into tech. And what I’ve learned about academic writing and tech content is that people and companies who tell the best stories often win the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how Figma moved from a niche design tool to an industry standard. Their storytelling centered around designers collaborating in real-time. By sharing stories of design teams achieving breakthrough moments together, they created emotional connections with their audience while showcasing product capabilities. Their collaboration and community narrative helped turn Figma into a $20 billion acquisition target and the go-to tool for design teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, I spoke with a startup founder who asked how people changed their minds on trying out a new technology. I told them that the strongest predictor of change I’ve noticed is when trusted individuals share how they’ve successfully used new technology. We’re naturally more inclined to trust those we know. That might be people we “know” online from their social media posts or people we know personally. When we have their recommendation or hear their story of how they’ve used the product, we’re more likely to trust the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little mantra captures the concept: features inform, but stories transform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-idea-framework-a-strategic-approach-to-startup-content&quot;&gt;The IDEA Framework: A Strategic Approach to Startup Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different frameworks out there, but I’ve combined a couple in a way that’s informed by my own experience bringing users to OpenSauced and years of content development. The IDEA framework connects storytelling to content as a growth-driver:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i---inspire&quot;&gt;I - Inspire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content needs to sparks curiosity and emotional connection. For startups, this might mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Origin stories that highlight your founding journey and the problem you’re solving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vision stories that paint a picture of the world you’re helping create&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer success narratives that let your users be the heroes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Spanx origin story from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://spanx.com/pages/about-us&quot;&gt;About Us page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SPANX founder Sara Blakely was getting ready for a party when she realized she didn’t have the right undergarment to provide a smooth look under white pants. Armed with scissors and sheer genius, she cut the feet off her control top pantyhose and the SPANX revolution began! With a focus on solving wardrobe woes, the SPANX brand has grown to offer bras, underwear, leggings, active and more. SPANX has secured its place in women’s hearts and in pop-culture with daily mentions everywhere from CNN to SNL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story captures the moment of inception and the expansion of the brand while demonstrating creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At OpenSauced, we saw continuous engagement when sharing stories of developers who found community through open source contribution. These narratives didn’t just showcase our platform, they inspired others to see what was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d---demonstrate&quot;&gt;D - Demonstrate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiration catches your audience’s attention, but to keep them around you need to draw them deeper. This is where demonstration comes in. In this context, demonstration is showing your solution in action. Here are some ways you can do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case studies that walk through specific problems and solutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interactive tutorials that give users immediate wins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparative analyses that honestly position your offering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community showcase that shows how real users have successfully used your product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion has perfected this approach by leveraging user stories to show the flexibility of their product. Instead of explaining features, they show real users from a variety of backgrounds and usecases and how they’ve built unique workflows. Authenticity is key here. Having examples that people trust from real users has helped pave the way for Notion’s explosive growth. Potential users can see themselves in the product through the stories of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This content doesn’t just tell. It shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;e---educate&quot;&gt;E - Educate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my previous response to the startup founder, I told them how important it is to educate your audience. Education hugely impacts adoption, builds trust, and positions you as an authority. Here are some ways to effectively educate your audience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear, well-organized, and up-to-date documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resources that solve common pain points and show why your product is useful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Industry reports that share valuable insights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How-to content, quickstart guides, and tutorials that create immediate value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostHog does an excellent job of educating users through their resources and their feature onboarding. Their comprehensive resources don’t just sell the product, they educate users to maximize their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational content also creates a reciprocity loop: you give knowledge freely, and users return the favor with their attention and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a---activate&quot;&gt;A - Activate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this process builds to what most companies want: activating the audience to take meaningful action. Additional ways to activate the audience include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community-building initiatives that encourage participation (hackathons, meetups, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product adoption pathways that reduce friction (onboarding content)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Opportunities for your users to share with others (share button, downloadable assets, collaboration requests, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our most successful campaigns at OpenSauced weren’t just about sharing what new features we were shipping. They were about empowering our community to become advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-storytelling-multiplier&quot;&gt;The Storytelling Multiplier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you weave storytelling through each stage of the IDEA framework, your content gains what I like to call the “storytelling multiplier effect.” I wrote about how to incorporate good storytelling last week in, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bekahhw.com/Storytelling-in-Tech&quot;&gt;The Power of Storytelling in Tech Content&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally, you’re not just communicating a feature. You’re creating an emotional connection and demonstrating real-world impact. That’s when the storytelling multiplier works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because humans are built for storytelling, we see clear ROIs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduced education costs: Stories make complex concepts more accessible and memorable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased retention: Emotional connections encourage loyalty and reduce churn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enhanced conversion: Narratives drive action more effectively than features and specifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementing-storytelling-in-your-startups-content-strategy&quot;&gt;Implementing Storytelling in Your Startup’s Content Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering where to start, here are a couple of things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit your current content&lt;/strong&gt;: Identify pieces that could be transformed with storytelling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collect narratives&lt;/strong&gt;: Systematically gather stories from customers, team members, and your founding journey.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create story templates&lt;/strong&gt;: Develop frameworks that help your team consistently incorporate narrative elements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure narrative engagement&lt;/strong&gt;: Look beyond standard metrics to measure how stories resonate (comment sentiment, sharing behavior, story recall).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-story-starts-now&quot;&gt;Your Story Starts Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every startup has stories worth telling. Stories of problems solved, of excited customers, of visions realized. These stories aren’t marketing assets; they’re growth drivers that can transform your content strategy from a cost center to a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storytelling’s transforms transactional relationships into emotional connections.
In a world of information overload (especially AI-generated information), storytelling isn’t optional. It’s essential. The startups that understand this will not only capture attention but also build the emotional connections that drive sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
