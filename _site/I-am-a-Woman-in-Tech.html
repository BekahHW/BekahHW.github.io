<p>That means that I am technical.<br />
That means that I am a community builder.
That means that I can give a technical talk in the same week that I mentor and MC an event.<br />
That means that I don’t want to be put in the project management track.<br />
That means that there are unexplored tech fields out there, and I’m going to explore them.<br />
That means that I will get stuck sometimes and ask for help.<br />
That means that I will be willing to share my experiences.<br />
That means that I will tell other women about who to avoid in tech.<br />
That means that I will know the answer or how to find it.<br />
That means that I am devoted to growing and learning and figuring it out.<br />
That means that what I value most is good people.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-a-mom-in-tech">I am a mom in tech.</h2>

<p>That means that I will not apologize when I put my kids first.<br />
That means that sometimes my kids will come into my camera range and wave or scream or cry or kick each other.<br />
That means that when I have time to code, I will put all the more drive into it.<br />
That means that tech will never be the most important thing in my life.<br />
That means that I recognize the importance of community, dependability, and flexibility.<br />
That means that I do not have time to waste.<br />
That means that I will not work with people who have a problem with that or who passive-aggressively comment on the number of children I have.<br />
That means that I have specific opinions, viewpoints, and perspectives on things that most other people in tech do not have.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-a-community-creator-in-tech">I am a community creator in tech.</h2>

<p>That means that I have a community that I am fiercely in support of.<br />
That means that I see every person as a human being before I ever look at them as a dev.<br />
That means that I allow myself to be vulnerable because I know how important that is.<br />
That means that I value community over competition, caring over pushing people to the very limits of their emotional wellbeing.<br />
That means that I value growth and mentorship and teaching at all levels.<br />
That means that I meet people where they are.<br />
That means that I value exploration.<br />
That means that people are what matter.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-an-adhd-person-in-tech">I am an ADHD person in tech.</h2>

<p>That means that I communicate differently than a lot of people I know.<br />
That means that sometimes when I’m really excited about an idea, I talk loud and fast and for a long time without realizing it.<br />
That means that sometimes I hyper-focus and it takes a longgggg time to break out of it.<br />
That means that other times, I can’t focus at all.<br />
That means that sometimes I feel things very intensely and find it hard to communicate.<br />
That means that sometimes I over-communicate.<br />
That means that I value my systems.<br />
That means that sometimes when other people are going to sleep I just can’t stop myself.<br />
That means that I deeply value the people who have agreed to come on this journey with me. <br />
That means that I’m running a marathon, but sprinting the whole time–and I love it.</p>

<p>I am a person in tech.<br />
I am dynamic and complex.<br />
I reserve the right to change at any time.<br />
I will not be labeled as one thing.<br />
I can do all of the things that I want, and if you tell me I can’t I’ll take that as a challenge.</p>
