<p>I’m only 5’1 and ¾.  That’s right, when you’re short, you count that ¾. Nothing’s going to change the fact that I’ve been this height since I was 11.  Apparently, though, some people think my height isn’t the only “short” thing about me.</p>

<p>I recently attended a webinar by some awesome reps of coding bootcamps/schools and asked the question: Is it worth it for a mom of four kids under nine to go through an intensive and expensive bootcamp if I’m only looking for PT or contract work when I’m done? The man who responded was incredibly positive, talking about moms as hard workers, goal-driven, and badasses. He finished with, don’t sell yourself short; you can be a great mom and work full time. I appreciated his positivity, but that last comment rubbed my short body the wrong way.</p>

<p>As a working mom, I’m not selling myself short by wanting to code PT or pick up contract work. Here’s why:</p>

<p><b>Part-time Work…</b></p>
<ul> <li>!= part-time passion;</li>
<li>!= part-time skill;</li>
<li>Encourages diversity;</li>
<li>Isn’t second-class work;</li>
<li>Allows PT employees to be just as invested in the mission and goals of the organization as FT employees;</li>
<li>Creates options. Moms know what’s best for them and their families;</li>
<li>Can increase <a href="http://doku.iab.de/discussionpapers/2017/dp2017.pdf#page=5">employee satisfaction</a>;</li>
<li>Creates flexibility for the employer and the employee;</li>
<li>Allows for a greater work-life balance for primary caretakers;</li>
<li>Lets me be the badass I am.</li></ul>

<p>Part-time workers are less valuable only when employers don’t respect or invest in their part-time workers. Right now in higher ed, we’re on the brink of radical changes because colleges and universities <a href="https://www.adjunctnation.com/2017/03/27/of-course-tenured-faculty-are-responsible-for-the-adjunct-crisis/">don’t invest in their part-time/contract adjunct faculty</a>. This is obviously not the model that tech should pick up. If the tech community wants to be inclusive, they must include and value the part-time employee. This part-time employee may be short in height, but I’m definitely not short on passion, determination, and diligence.</p>
