      <id>http://localhost:4000/How%20I%20Accidentally%20Interviewed%20for%20Two%20Jobs,%20a%20series</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/How-I-Accidentally-Interviewed-for-Two-Jobs,-a-series">&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard people say they interview for practice or for fun. I am not one of those people. I am the opposite of those people. On top of being not one of those people, I am also a person who is incredibly satisfied with my job and life, except as an independent contractor my family and I pay out of pocket for medical insurance. And I have over $70,000 of medical bills sitting on my desk with more coming. So when someone from a notable company in tech reached out to me and encouraged me to apply to a DevRel position, and then when I talked to a friend in tech who encouraged me to apply for a senior DevRel position, I did. This is the first in a series of posts on what I’ve learned through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-ok-to-say-no-or-recommend-someone-else&quot;&gt;It’s Ok to say no or recommend someone else&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an early-career developer who gets maybe more DMs than most early-career devs because of what I’ve done with &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve had a number of people reach out and ask me to apply for jobs. Usually, I decline and recommend someone else I know. If you look at the job, and it’s not something that’s interesting, within your desired salary, or you find out more about the team and you don’t think you’d be a good fit, it’s ok to pass or to recommend someone else you think would be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-your-research-and-reach-out-to-people-you-trust&quot;&gt;Do Your Research and Reach out to People you Trust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming into tech, I’ve always said that my dream job is working with good people. And that’s 100% true for me. I have been working with good–actually amazing–people. I’ve also seen so many devs fall into really toxic work environments. So if I’m going to leave a situation I’m happy with, I’m going to do my research. For me this means learning about the people on the teams, the companies, and DMing people who I know in tech and asking them about the teams, companies, and/or positions. Through these DMs, I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some tough questions to ask to gauge the strength of the teams and to avoid workplace toxicity;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to gauge the sincerity of responses;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How current teams functioned within the organization and how that would impact the position;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What the current team dynamics are;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About the projects, processes, and structures the teams use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ask-direct-questions&quot;&gt;Ask Direct Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I wasn’t actively looking for work, I came to the process with a privileged position. I could afford to ask questions that some might be afraid to ask initially. Some of the questions I asked prior to the interviews were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s the salary range?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Could I continue organizing Virtual Coffee as part of the job?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are your current pain points?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the schedule flexible?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does the health insurance like?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we talk about the title?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; interviewing them as well. If you have values or standards that are important to you, it’s ok to be selective from the very beginning. In fact, it was the openness and honesty of the answers that made me feel comfortable going further in the process, which I’ll talk about in my next post, because these weren’t quick and simple processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">Notes from Twitter Spaces on Community and Remote Work</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/Notes-from-Twitter-Spaces-on-Community-and-Remote-Work" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Notes from Twitter Spaces on Community and Remote Work" />
      <published>2021-06-28T00:00:00-04:00</published>
      <updated>2021-06-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/Notes%20from%20Twitter%20Spaces%20on%20Community%20and%20Remote%20Work</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Notes-from-Twitter-Spaces-on-Community-and-Remote-Work">&lt;p&gt;My notes from the last two weeks of Twitter spaces I hosted. These are not all my ideas, and I might not agree with them all. But, I wanted to share what we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;community--career&quot;&gt;Community + Career&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-be-a-part-of-a-community&quot;&gt;Why should you be a part of a community?*&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helps with career guidance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports you as you grow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows for networking opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates a safe space for exploring new ideas and industries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provides opportunities to help others&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As always, this depends on the community you join. Not all experiences will be the same for all people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-the-community-that-supports-its-members&quot;&gt;Find the community that supports its members&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re looking to join a community, here are some signs that the community supports its members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authentic and vulnerable relationships and interactions,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investment in helping each other to grow -&amp;gt; look at how people are answering questions or if help and support posts are mostly answered,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Openness to new ideas and experiences -&amp;gt; are members testing out new ideas or actions? Do you see people saying they’ve done something for the first time as part of that group?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supportive communities can provide a space for you to try new things. For example, maybe you’re interested in speaking at a conference, but you’re afraid. If you have a supportive community, it’s easier to try out the experience. Give your presentation to the community and ask for feedback. When you have a supportive community, it’s easier to be open to feedback, to learn from the experience, and to work towards your goal of giving a presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-find-the-right-communities&quot;&gt;How to find the right communities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure they have a code of conduct, esp if you’re part of an under-represented group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They all you to be a passive member of a community -&amp;gt; soak up the knowledge and experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;signs-of-a-positive-community&quot;&gt;Signs of a positive community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a Code of Conduct&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For non-discord platforms, when people use their real names&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Members of under-represented groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;remote-work&quot;&gt;Remote Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some companies did even better when they were forced to go remote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can do the same thing from home that you can do in the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PPl are forming networks and relationships outside of the office as a result. There’s less glue, holding you to stick in the current position.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t have the opportunities to network outside of the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remote and COVID-remote are two very different things. There are a lot of extra outside stressors. Remote was being thrust on ppl rather than a decision people made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-work-in-a-physical-office&quot;&gt;Why work in a physical office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some people prefer to work in the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extrovert!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear physical lines of communication: You can walk to the person’s office if you have a question.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes a challenge of getting work done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a different type of productivity -&amp;gt; talking with the people around you allows you to develop relationships more quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You build teams much quicker in the office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community building is easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;positives-of-working-remotely&quot;&gt;Positives of working remotely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexibility, especially for parents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows parents to take breaks and spend time with their kids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t have to commute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows for productive breaks -&amp;gt; You can start the laundry, dinner, do errands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigating-challenges-of-working-remotely&quot;&gt;Navigating challenges of working remotely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t have a designated office space, it can be a challenge, but if you set boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set rules for yourself: when to log off. Turn off the computer and don’t touch it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do a full shutdown every night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Separate work and “home” computer, so there’s no drive to work after work hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set a hard limit for work hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dealing with stress and the easy access to food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normalize kid noises in the back of every meeting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Productivity: there’s kind of no middle ground. There’s ppl who are super productive and not productive at all. This might speak to the type of office-environment that works best for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We shouldn’t be micromanaging. Daily standup, project tracking, and milestones are enough to evaluated the productivity of the team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forcing extra steps to force ppl to report progress, that’s toxic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there’s an issue with a person, approach it as “How can we support you? Is there a challenge I can help you with?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers should have autonomy and support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over-communication &amp;gt; under-communication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t do remote work on vacation!!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team-building remotely: Depending on the team, turn on the cameras, hear the voice of the other person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whole set of problems returning to office spaces now with mice, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus&quot;&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;blog post idea: how to structure your team to be productive&lt;/li&gt;

      <updated>2021-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/Code%20+%20Community:%20the%20highlight%20reel</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Code-+-Community-the-highlight-reel">&lt;p&gt;Last week, we wrapped up our second season of the Virtual Coffee (VC) Podcast with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/0209-season-two-wrapup/&quot;&gt;Code and Community episode&lt;/a&gt;. As VC’s been growing over the last year, I’ve been working on the Virtual Coffee model for communities, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danieltott&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; and I have spent a lot of time talking through navigating the challenges and creating a direction for our unique community with the support and care of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was especially inspired to write a highlight version of the episode when I saw Lucia’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BekahHW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@BekahHW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danieltott?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@danieltott&lt;/a&gt; are leaders in effective, unconventional ways. Listen for their view on metrics, community building, and purpose. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4FyYJhafO7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4FyYJhafO7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lucia Cerchie 🦎 (@CerchieLucia) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CerchieLucia/status/1400135495984709632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my top takeaways from this episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have so many ideas for the community, but there aren’t enough hours in the day to work on them all. We’re doing our best to prioritize them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re more than a slack of people who do meetups, events, and more. We’re “an intimate community for all devs, optimized for you.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The face-to-face conversations are a key part of our identity. And it’s important to us that we keep our breakout rooms small to allow opportunities for everyone to join in the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s easier to stretch and grow when you know you have the support of the community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re inspired by the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.radicalcandor.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radical Candor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! Clear and honest communication are important tools for trust and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We think of Virtual Coffee as an open source community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building deliberately and creating structures and processes to empower members to help takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re never going to put content behind a paywall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tooling with a team can be really expensive, and it’s challenging to find services that allow people to help when you have a small community and no funding .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The goal of the Virtual Coffee Model is to have a lasting impact on your community, to create ripples that extend far beyond your community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So much of community tooling is based on making money off our your members. Since that’s not our goal, it’s been challenging to find a good fit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As community leadership, you can see each person individually and you can recognize them, but if you don’t have support in the tools, in the structures, you’re not going to get very far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traditional community metrics leave a lot of people out. We value each member participating in the ways that are most comfortable for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our focus isn’t to grow &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, it’s to support our members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content>

      <updated>2021-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/I%20did%20something%20that%20scared%20me:%20I%20took%20a%20week%20off</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/I-did-something-that-scared-me-I-took-a-week-off">&lt;p&gt;A friend recently asked me if I am a results or a process person. I told her that I’m a momentum person. I like to move. I don’t like breaks. But when we hit the one year mark of &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, and I realized that I hadn’t had a week off in a year I didn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to take time off, but I thought I probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. And it was the right call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-had-time-to-work-on-things-i-missed&quot;&gt;I had time to work on things I missed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem of being momentum-driven is that you go with the flow and the things that excite you. And when you have a community of a couple hundred people, there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of cool ideas. And I’ve been full force on the Virtual Coffee train for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking time off created time for me to revisit some of the things I love doing. I coded more. I worked on my postpartum wellness app. I spent less time on my phone. I spent time thinking about what I want and where I want to be. I created a new system for tasks and project for myself (it’s colored post-it notes that I stick on my wall, but it’s been great for brainstorming and prioritizing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to do a personal training session for the first time in a very long time. I worked on three different kinds of box jumps, because when you’re as short as I am, you’ve gotta make up for that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had fun. I had energizing conversations. I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-had-the-opportunity-to-do-some-tough-self-evaluation&quot;&gt;I had the opportunity to do some tough self-evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday at 9:00am EDT–when I usually host Virtual Coffee–I worked with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://katiecmckenna.com/&quot;&gt;favorite career coach&lt;/a&gt;, who helped me to breakdown tasks, prioritize, and to think strategically and practically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just finished meeting with the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katiecmckenna?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@katiecmckenna&lt;/a&gt; and it’s always a great use of my time. She asks the hard questions, says the things that are hard to hear, and helps me to believe in myself. (Also, she’s hilarious, kind, and a great author.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TfQDUVAggz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/TfQDUVAggz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bekah Hawrot Weigel (@BekahHW) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BekahHW/status/1384513366190866436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She made me break down the hours I spend on work and Virtual Coffee, and helped me realize some hard truths about some bad habits I was forming. She helped me find action items and made plans to hold me accountable. (If she asks, yes I am working on them!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at how I’ve been doing things from an objective level, from the perspective of “what advice would you give someone else who told you this is what they’ve been doing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that burnout happens in different ways and with different feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about the importance of boundaries and clearly setting them up. Because I’ve continually said that I have boundaries, but they’re easy to blur when you don’t have a clear guide to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I probably wasn’t doing a good job of providing an example for the Virtual Coffee members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I need to believe in myself, to acknowledge my strengths rather than devaluing them, and to recognize that what I’m doing–both as a developer and a community builder–is good and worthwhile work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-can-come-back-with-renewed-energy&quot;&gt;I can come back with renewed energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would be anxious the whole week. It was like leaving my kids for a weekend with my parents the first time. I was sad the first day, but then I inhaled deeply and felt renewed and refreshed and ready to jump back in after the break was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed it without knowing that I needed it. As an introvert, I’ve not done a great job of recognizing how impacted I’ve been by constantly being engaged. I’ve somehow developed the ability to get through the week, and then I hit the weekend and feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. I didn’t feel that this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of my “action items” from this break is to take a week off every quarter. Because I know it’s good for me, and it’s good for the community too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-could-see-the-virtual-coffee-pain-points-more-clearly&quot;&gt;I could see the Virtual Coffee pain points more clearly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating space between myself and the community also allowed me to not be caught up in all the day-to-day organizing and responding and allowed me to see things from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could walk through things without having to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the things. And I could much better identify where the chaos happens, where processes can be improved, where things are working well, where the community has really done a great job of innovating and responding to the groups needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-im-at-now&quot;&gt;Where I’m at now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m three days into my first week back at Virtual Coffee, and I’m proud of myself for working on ways to set boundaries, to not let myself fall back into old habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happy to see my friends. And that’s part of what makes this so hard. This community, these people, they’re my people. They’re the people I enjoy being around. They’re the people I want to share my wins and losses with. And maybe that’s how all community creators feel, or maybe that’s what happens when you accidentally start a community. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do know that providing the best support for the community means that I’ll need to take more time off, and that I need to prioritize creating clearer paths of communication and support. And it probably means that I need to tell myself that I can do this. Even though I’m afraid that I’m not the best person to be doing this, I can do it, and I can learn, and I can grow into the person I want to while doing this, with the support of the community.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <summary type="html">A friend recently asked me if I am a results or a process person. I told her that I’m a momentum person. I like to move. I don’t like breaks. But when we hit the one year mark of Virtual Coffee, and I realized that I hadn’t had a week off in a year I didn’t want to take time off, but I thought I probably should.

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Coding-is-Pattern-Matching">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I was talking to a woman who was doing simultaneous Masters degrees from Carnegie Mellon University and running a brain study on chronic depression. When we were talking about her multiple degrees and her musical experience, all while she let me pick her brain about neurology, she said something that stuck with me, “All life is pattern-matching.” She explained the connections between her mathematical and scientific experience with her creative endeavors, and it made sense. Patterns are everywhere, and we learn through recognizing and seeing the patterns, internalizing them, applying them, and eventually understanding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the approach I try to turn to when I’m frustrated with myself when I don’t “understand” the code that I’m seeing on the page. And &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is a perspective that I would’ve benefitted from when I was learning to code, but most recently now, it’s what I lean into when I’m frustrated with myself for not understanding new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-why-is-a-pattern-matching-perspective-important-to-coding&quot;&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is a pattern-matching perspective important to coding?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’ve let out some desperate cries to the universe to &lt;em&gt;please just let me get this so I can move on!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then one night, the magical neural-pathway fairy comes and sprinkles its coding dust onto my brain and I wake up, and suddenly it’s clicked. And I can’t remember why I couldn’t get it the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the perspective that coding is pattern-matching removes (at least some of) that frustration, tames those desperate cries to the universe, and empowers my progress rather than prohibits it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-does-pattern-matching-for-coding-even-mean&quot;&gt;But &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; does pattern-matching for coding even mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you get hung up on “understanding” all of the concepts. And, of course, that’s important. But you shouldn’t be stuck on learning the same thing over and over in the attempt to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; understand something. That will come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pattern-matching perspective: Looking at the patterns in code and being able to replicate those patterns in other projects. You don’t have to know why the pieces work, just that they are the pieces, and how they match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s look at a JavaScript Object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const person = {name: 'Leslie', job:'Parks and Recreation Deputy Director', favoriteFood:'waffles'}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe we need to create another person object. We don’t need to know why there are curly braces here or why there are colons. We don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know that there are keys and values. We need to recognize the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to recognize is that there are general attribute indicators (name, job, favoriteFood), that are followed by colons and then specific information, wrapped in quotes. And all of this is wrapped in curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re just breaking down the pieces so we can apply this in our own situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is that the more I apply the code that I’ve learned in practical ways (real world projects), the more I’m able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone would’ve told me that I needed to totally understand all of JavaScript before moving on to React, I would still be learning JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t be waiting to fully understand. Tech changes so quickly that full mastery likely won’t ever happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m moving into new projects, I’m taking this mindset with me. I’m looking for patterns and applying them. The next step is recognizing what we need in our coding projects by seeing the patterns in the code. And maybe that sparks an Aha! moment, like I could really use a useEffect here. Or using grid seems like a practical choice here. (But that Aha! moment deserves its own blog post.) And finally, those patterns click in our brains and we start to understand the hows and whys and whats of coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
