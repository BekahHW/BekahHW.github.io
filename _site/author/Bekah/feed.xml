      <id>http://localhost:4000/I%20did%20something%20that%20scared%20me:%20I%20took%20a%20week%20off</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/I-did-something-that-scared-me-I-took-a-week-off">&lt;p&gt;A friend recently asked me if I am a results or a process person. I told her that I’m a momentum person. I like to move. I don’t like breaks. But when we hit the one year mark of &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualcoffee.io/&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, and I realized that I hadn’t had a week off in a year I didn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to take time off, but I thought I probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. And it was the right call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-had-time-to-work-on-things-i-missed&quot;&gt;I had time to work on things I missed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem of being momentum-driven is that you go with the flow and the things that excite you. And when you have a community of a couple hundred people, there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of cool ideas. And I’ve been full force on the Virtual Coffee train for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking time off created time for me to revisit some of the things I love doing. I coded more. I worked on my postpartum wellness app. I spent less time on my phone. I spent time thinking about what I want and where I want to be. I created a new system for tasks and project for myself (it’s colored post-it notes that I stick on my wall, but it’s been great for brainstorming and prioritizing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to do a personal training session for the first time in a very long time. I worked on three different kinds of box jumps, because when you’re as short as I am, you’ve gotta make up for that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had fun. I had energizing conversations. I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-had-the-opportunity-to-do-some-tough-self-evaluation&quot;&gt;I had the opportunity to do some tough self-evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday at 9:00am EDT–when I usually host Virtual Coffee–I worked with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://katiecmckenna.com/&quot;&gt;favorite career coach&lt;/a&gt;, who helped me to breakdown tasks, prioritize, and to think strategically and practically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just finished meeting with the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katiecmckenna?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@katiecmckenna&lt;/a&gt; and it’s always a great use of my time. She asks the hard questions, says the things that are hard to hear, and helps me to believe in myself. (Also, she’s hilarious, kind, and a great author.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TfQDUVAggz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/TfQDUVAggz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bekah Hawrot Weigel (@BekahHW) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BekahHW/status/1384513366190866436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She made me break down the hours I spend on work and Virtual Coffee, and helped me realize some hard truths about some bad habits I was forming. She helped me find action items and made plans to hold me accountable. (If she asks, yes I am working on them!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at how I’ve been doing things from an objective level, from the perspective of “what advice would you give someone else who told you this is what they’ve been doing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that burnout happens in different ways and with different feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about the importance of boundaries and clearly setting them up. Because I’ve continually said that I have boundaries, but they’re easy to blur when you don’t have a clear guide to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I probably wasn’t doing a good job of providing an example for the Virtual Coffee members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I need to believe in myself, to acknowledge my strengths rather than devaluing them, and to recognize that what I’m doing–both as a developer and a community builder–is good and worthwhile work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-can-come-back-with-renewed-energy&quot;&gt;I can come back with renewed energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would be anxious the whole week. It was like leaving my kids for a weekend with my parents the first time. I was sad the first day, but then I inhaled deeply and felt renewed and refreshed and ready to jump back in after the break was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed it without knowing that I needed it. As an introvert, I’ve not done a great job of recognizing how impacted I’ve been by constantly being engaged. I’ve somehow developed the ability to get through the week, and then I hit the weekend and feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. I didn’t feel that this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of my “action items” from this break is to take a week off every quarter. Because I know it’s good for me, and it’s good for the community too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-could-see-the-virtual-coffee-pain-points-more-clearly&quot;&gt;I could see the Virtual Coffee pain points more clearly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating space between myself and the community also allowed me to not be caught up in all the day-to-day organizing and responding and allowed me to see things from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could walk through things without having to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the things. And I could much better identify where the chaos happens, where processes can be improved, where things are working well, where the community has really done a great job of innovating and responding to the groups needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-im-at-now&quot;&gt;Where I’m at now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m three days into my first week back at Virtual Coffee, and I’m proud of myself for working on ways to set boundaries, to not let myself fall back into old habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happy to see my friends. And that’s part of what makes this so hard. This community, these people, they’re my people. They’re the people I enjoy being around. They’re the people I want to share my wins and losses with. And maybe that’s how all community creators feel, or maybe that’s what happens when you accidentally start a community. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do know that providing the best support for the community means that I’ll need to take more time off, and that I need to prioritize creating clearer paths of communication and support. And it probably means that I need to tell myself that I can do this. Even though I’m afraid that I’m not the best person to be doing this, I can do it, and I can learn, and I can grow into the person I want to while doing this, with the support of the community.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>http://localhost:4000/Coding%20is%20Pattern-Matching</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Coding-is-Pattern-Matching">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I was talking to a woman who was doing simultaneous Masters degrees from Carnegie Mellon University and running a brain study on chronic depression. When we were talking about her multiple degrees and her musical experience, all while she let me pick her brain about neurology, she said something that stuck with me, “All life is pattern-matching.” She explained the connections between her mathematical and scientific experience with her creative endeavors, and it made sense. Patterns are everywhere, and we learn through recognizing and seeing the patterns, internalizing them, applying them, and eventually understanding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the approach I try to turn to when I’m frustrated with myself when I don’t “understand” the code that I’m seeing on the page. And &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is a perspective that I would’ve benefitted from when I was learning to code, but most recently now, it’s what I lean into when I’m frustrated with myself for not understanding new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-why-is-a-pattern-matching-perspective-important-to-coding&quot;&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is a pattern-matching perspective important to coding?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’ve let out some desperate cries to the universe to &lt;em&gt;please just let me get this so I can move on!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then one night, the magical neural-pathway fairy comes and sprinkles its coding dust onto my brain and I wake up, and suddenly it’s clicked. And I can’t remember why I couldn’t get it the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the perspective that coding is pattern-matching removes (at least some of) that frustration, tames those desperate cries to the universe, and empowers my progress rather than prohibits it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-does-pattern-matching-for-coding-even-mean&quot;&gt;But &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; does pattern-matching for coding even mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you get hung up on “understanding” all of the concepts. And, of course, that’s important. But you shouldn’t be stuck on learning the same thing over and over in the attempt to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; understand something. That will come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pattern-matching perspective: Looking at the patterns in code and being able to replicate those patterns in other projects. You don’t have to know why the pieces work, just that they are the pieces, and how they match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s look at a JavaScript Object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const person = {name: 'Leslie', job:'Parks and Recreation Deputy Director', favoriteFood:'waffles'}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe we need to create another person object. We don’t need to know why there are curly braces here or why there are colons. We don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know that there are keys and values. We need to recognize the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to recognize is that there are general attribute indicators (name, job, favoriteFood), that are followed by colons and then specific information, wrapped in quotes. And all of this is wrapped in curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re just breaking down the pieces so we can apply this in our own situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is that the more I apply the code that I’ve learned in practical ways (real world projects), the more I’m able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone would’ve told me that I needed to totally understand all of JavaScript before moving on to React, I would still be learning JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t be waiting to fully understand. Tech changes so quickly that full mastery likely won’t ever happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m moving into new projects, I’m taking this mindset with me. I’m looking for patterns and applying them. The next step is recognizing what we need in our coding projects by seeing the patterns in the code. And maybe that sparks an Aha! moment, like I could really use a useEffect here. Or using grid seems like a practical choice here. (But that Aha! moment deserves its own blog post.) And finally, those patterns click in our brains and we start to understand the hows and whys and whats of coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
