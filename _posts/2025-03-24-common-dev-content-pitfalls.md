Last week, I wrote about [Content Developers Love](https://bekahhw.com/Creating-Content-Developers-Love), and it's natural to follow that with some of the places where developer content goes wrong. It's usually not one thing that causes documentation to go wrong; it can be death by a thousand papercuts. Learning how to recognize some of the common problems can keep your writing on track or help you catch it before the problem becomes too big.


## 1. Outdated Information: The Trust Killer

There's only one path that outdated documentation leads to: frustration. Maintaining a large documentation base can be challenging to keep up, especially if there isn't clear communication with engineering teams, but every effort should be made to keep documentation up to date with the current version of your product. Outdated documentation will decrease trust with your users, and that's hard to rebuild. 

**Solution:** Implement a systematic content review process tied to your release cycle. As part of this, you can:

- Version tag all code examples
- Automate testing of any documentation code samples
- Perform quarterly technical reviews of developer-facing content
- Add Changelog links embedded within documentation

## 2. Missing Prerequisites: The Silent Blocker

Any content that assumes knowledge or setup that developers don't have creates immediate friction. What's obvious to you may be a complete mystery to someone new to your ecosystem.

**Solution:** 

- Create a "Before You Begin" checklist at the start of each tutorial
- Clearly state prerequisites at the beginning of each piece of content
- Provide links to resources that help developers meet these prerequisites
- Test your content with developers who are new to your product

One of the ways I like to think about approaching documentation is as "User 0", meaning I’m the first person to go through the process, encounter the pitfalls, and document not just what works, but what didn’t, so that others don’t have to. You have to think like a user who's engaging with the documentation for the first time, making sure the experience is intuitive, clear, and kind to anyone coming in fresh.

## 3. Undisclosed Limitations: The Hidden Trap

Developers appreciate honesty about what your solution can't do as much as clarity about what it can do. Nobody wants to feel "tricked" into thinking they can do something with your product only to find out that it can't do that, takes substantial investment to implement a workaround, or it's somewhere down the roadmap.

**Solution:**

- Create dedicated "Limitations" or "Considerations" sections
- Be transparent about edge cases and known issues
- Offer workarounds when possible
- Update limitation documentation as your product evolves

## 4. Neglecting the "Why": The Context Gap

Developers aren't just implementing solutions, they're making architectural decisions. They need to understand the reasoning behind recommendations to adapt them appropriately.

**Solution:**

- Explain the rationale behind design patterns or recommended approaches
- Provide context for best practices rather than just stating them
- Share trade-offs considered when making architectural recommendations

## 5. Tutorial Cliffs: The Abandonment Point

One of the biggest gaps I’ve seen is that there’s a lot of great beginner (101-level) content and then a sharp jump to advanced (400-level) documentation. That creates a “tutorial cliff,” or a sudden drop in learning support.  Part of creating a good content library means filling in those gaps, including 100, 200, 300, *and* 400 level content to support a variety of users.

**Solution:**

- Map your content to a complete developer journey
- Create explicit "next steps" at the end of introductory content
- Build "intermediate" content that bridges tutorials and reference
- Provide "recipe" style content for common implementation patterns

## 6. Poor Organization: The Structure Problem

You can have the best, most comprehensive documentation, but if it's poorly organized, developers won't be able to use it effectively and are more likely to choose an alternative due to frustration.

**Solution:**

- Organize content by both task and concept (dual navigation)
- Create clear hierarchies with consistent depth and breadth
- Use progressive disclosure (show users only the most essential information, but allow them to access more complex or detailed information through deliberate interaction like clicking, expanding, etc.) to prevent overwhelming users
- Implement topic relationships and "see also" sections

## 7. Missing Troubleshooting Guidance: The Dead-End Dilemma

When documentation only covers the happy path and doesn't address common errors or problems, developers hit roadblocks.

**Solution:**

- Incorporate error message explanations directly in documentation
- Create dedicated troubleshooting sections for common failure points
- Document known edge cases and their workarounds
- Include debugging strategies specific to your platform
- Analyze support tickets to identify and document recurring issues

## Turning Pitfalls into Opportunities

Each of these mistakes represents an opportunity to improve the developer experience. The good news? Most companies are making at least some of these errors, creating a competitive advantage for those who address them.

## An Actionable Approach to Improvement

If you're looking to improve your developer content, start with this simple process:

1. **Audit:** Evaluate your current content against the pitfalls outlined above
2. **Prioritize:** Identify the top 2-3 issues causing the most friction
3. **Implement:** Make targeted improvements to address these specific pitfalls
4. **Measure:** Track the impact of your changes on developer satisfaction and product adoption
5. **Iterate:** Continuously refine based on feedback and changing needs

## Excellence Through Empathy

At its core, avoiding these pitfalls requires genuine empathy for your developer audience. By understanding their needs, frustrations, and workflows, you can create content that not only avoids common problems but also empowers developers to succeed with your product.

Great developer documentation is both about technical accuracy and creating an experience that respects developers' time, intelligence, and goals.
