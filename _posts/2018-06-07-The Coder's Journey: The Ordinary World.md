Last night, it hit me. Learning to code is the same thing as  what Joseph Campbell famously called the monomyth. Like the heroes of our favorite myths or action movies, we start with a call to adventure and dream about making it to the end. The next couple of posts will break done the Coder's Journey, a take on the monomyth:

## The Call to Adventure
We meet the CODE NEWBIE. Alone. Wondering, "There must be something better out there, right?" But she's been doing the same thing for so long, she's practically glued to her seat. She gives a longing glance over at the office space with the beer on tap and espresso machine. She sighs, empties her kids' veggie sticks from her sweater, and goes back to her monotonous job.

But then...DING. It's an email inviting her to an event, in that office space with the beer, to learn more about coding. It's free. There's beer.

## Refusal of the Call
So she goes to the event. The floors shine. Plants hang from the ceiling. There's Dogfish Head 90minute IPA on tap. The people are excited, supportive, and encouraging. They want to teach her. But...but...but..."I have a job. I have kids to worry about. I'm too old to start a new career. I don't have enough time as it is. I've never been mathematical. I don't know where to start. This is like learning another language, and I failed Spanish."

## Supernatural Aid
But it's not over. Our coder starts to walk out, but just as she reaches for the door, a stranger shouts, "Hey code newbie, I know you think you can't do it, but you can. Just see if you like it. You can start for free. No stakes. There's nothing to lose."

## Crossing the First Threshold
She sits at a table in front of a sleek MacBook and types
"Hello world!"
