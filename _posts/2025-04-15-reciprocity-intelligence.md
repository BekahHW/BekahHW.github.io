*In this second post of my series on giving and taking, I explore why reciprocity intelligence—the ability to navigate giving and receiving effectively—isn’t just nice to have anymore. If you missed the first post, [start here](https://bekahhw.com/company-culture-of-reciprocity)*.

## We Don’t Talk about…Reciprocity Intelligence (but we should)

I’ve always been drawn to the idea that core skills like empathy, communication, and resilience aren’t fixed skills, but learnable ones. You also might know them as “intelligences”: emotional intelligence, cultural intelligence, and even digital intelligence. Basically, they shape how we understand and navigate relationships and environments.

But there’s one form of intelligence I don't hear people talking about even though it defines how we operate in teams and communities: reciprocity intelligence.

Reciprocity intelligence is the ability to move skillfully between giving and receiving. It’s knowing when to offer help, when to ask for it, and how to manage the emotions that come with both. It’s recognizing that generosity is situational and not a permanent identity. You’re not always a “giver” or a “taker.” You shift based on your capacity, your context, and your needs.

The good news is that like any intelligence, reciprocity intelligence is something you can grow.

## The Research Behind Reciprocity Skills

Although it's not likely referred to as reciprocity intelligence, the concept is gaining attention in research that is focused on its underlying skills. For example, Grant and Dutton (2012) found that when people are encouraged to think about times they gave or received help, they’re more likely to keep that generosity going at work. Even small reflection prompts can lead to more giving and collaboration on teams.

In the last twenty years, we’ve seen gratitude journaling become wildly popular. It should be no surprise that the focus is often on giving or receiving, and it has been proven to boost your mood and strengthen your relationships. These studies aren’t directly about reciprocity, but they show how simple reflection can spark more positive social behavior and help reduce stress.

From the neuroscience angle, Harbaugh and his team (2007) used brain scans to show that giving to others lights up the brain’s reward centers. Generosity feels good. Voluntary giving seems to bring the biggest reward.

And this isn’t a single culture thing either. Cross-cultural research from Henrich et al. (2005) shows the idea of reciprocity shows up in cultures all over the world, and is practiced in many different ways. So what we can take away from this is that reciprocity is universal, but the actual skills to navigate it are shaped by culture and can be taught.

## Seasons of Giving and Taking

In my experience with [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/) over the past five years, I've moved through distinct phases of giving and receiving. When I founded the community, I was primarily in a giving season and spent a lot of time organizing, mentoring, and speaking to early career developers. But eventually, I started to recognize the signs of burnout. This was also an opportunity to become a matcher or taker. I had to accept help, to allow others to contribute, to recognize that if I did it all on my own, I was on a fast-track to helping no one. I had to find that balance. And I needed to understand what that balance meant for me and take that knowledge and understanding with me to everything I did so I didn’t face burnout doing the things I love.

This recognition, that we all move through seasons where we may give more or receive more, is central to reciprocity intelligence. The skill development means that you should be able to:
- Recognize your current season without shame or guilt
- Communicate your capacity transparently
- Build a "reciprocity bank" through consistent giving when able
- Withdraw thoughtfully when needed


## The Hidden Costs of False Giving

Maybe one of the most insidious challenges in workplace or community dynamics is what I call "false giving.” False giving is generosity theater. It looks like help, but it costs more than it contributes. And when it’s unchecked, it spreads by slowly draining the energy of the real contributors. Sometimes people “pass” as givers by volunteering. But when they deliver substandard work, it ultimately creates more work for others. What makes this particularly damaging is that it masquerades as contribution, offers support for the team/community, promises decreased workloads, etc. In reality, it takes value, time, and unplanned resources from your team. It becomes a virus that, if not addressed, can go deep into your veins and seriously damage your team's health.

Research on team dynamics and “social loafing” shows that when team members perceive others as not contributing, it can lead to frustration and resentment within the group ([Social Loafing and Its Effects on the Workplace](https://ijip.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18.01.375.20241202.pdf)).Teams generally function better and show more mutual respect when members are honest about their limitations and boundaries (for reference, check out: [Understand team
effectiveness](https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness) and [Team Dynamics: The Backbone of Effective Collaboration](https://www.vantagecircle.com/en/blog/team-dynamics/)).

## Have the Hard Conversations

I'm a huge proponent of having hard conversations when you need to, and this especially applies to team dynamics. In the first year of Virtual Coffee, we read *Radical Candor*, and it opened my mind to understand the disservice you do when you don’t give people honest and candid feedback. The fact is, when someone consistently takes without investing, it burns people out and damages relationships, teams, and communities. I've witnessed firsthand how just one or two chronic takers can deplete an entire team's motivation.

Reciprocity intelligence includes the ability to address imbalances directly. This is why it’s important to be able to give to others by having honest conversations about their impact. With this approach, you can better understand how to have that conversation in a way that makes clear what the boundaries of giving and taking are. Early conflict resolution can address giving and taking imbalances that create healthier team dynamics.

## Developing Your Reciprocity Intelligence

I mentioned earlier that you can grow in reciprocity intelligence. That’s not helpful unless you know how. Based on both research and experience, here are some practical steps I think you can use to develop your reciprocity intelligence:

### Practice Reciprocity Awareness

- Track your giving and taking behaviors across different relationships
- Notice which interactions energize versus deplete you
- Identify your "giving strengths" (the types of contribution that come naturally). 

For instance, you might like taking someone a meal after they’ve had a child, but feel depleted when you have to organize three weeks' worth of meals for them. Or maybe you enjoy pair programming with a junior developer, but creating a mentorship plan for junior developers felt exhausting.

Being aware can help you restructure your giving to focus on your strengths.

### Build Recovery into Giving

- Set boundaries around your giving to prevent burnout
- Schedule recovery time after intensive giving periods
- Develop rituals that help you recharge your "giving battery"

You might find that you need a 2-for-1 giving rule, where for every two giving activities you might need a recovery activity (reading, taking a walk, an evening without community responsibilities, etc.). Identify necessary boundaries to prevent burnout. 

### Learn to Receive Gracefully

- Practice accepting help without feeling diminished
- Express specific appreciation for support
- Recognize that allowing others to give benefits them too

Sometimes you need to practice saying “thank you,” instead of “I got this.” It’s also worth noting that when you allow others to help you, they might find joy in helping. You’re empowering them to be a giver in a way that energizes them.

### Communicate Your Capacity

- Be transparent about your current giving capacity
- Signal shifting capacity before reaching burnout
- Frame limitations as temporary seasons rather than permanent states
- Be specific about what you can and cannot handle so people don’t have to guess. You don’t have to offer explanations, but you do have to share that you need help. 

A low-level way to communicate capacity is to implement a simple traffic light system: green means I have capacity to help, yellow means I'm at my limit but can handle quick questions or issues, and red means I need to focus on existing commitments or I’m at capacity. Visual cues help set expectations without requiring constant explanations.

### Invest in Reciprocity Education

- Provide team training on healthy giving and receiving (this also helps to set expectations)
- Discuss reciprocity norms explicitly in your organization
- Recognize and celebrate balanced contributors

Anecdotally, I’ve seen givers doing the majority of giving year after year after year until they burnout in communities, as volunteers, on teams, and really any aspect of life. If you’re running a team, think about offering onboarding about reciprocity patterns or having quarterly retros that include a reciprocity patterns that allow for better knowledge sharing. 

When you cultivate reciprocity intelligence experience, you can lower burnout rates, create a more equitable distribution of effort, allow for stronger team cohesion, encourage greater innovation through psychological safety, and see a higher retention rate of top talent.

## A Personal Reflection

It can be hard as a giver to not give, especially if you're used to giving to others who normally reciprocate. You want to believe everyone will be willing to give back, to send ripples out into the world, but that's not always the case. The most sustainable communities and teams are those where reciprocity intelligence is valued as a core skill and where members understand the rhythm of giving and receiving that sustains us all.



*In the next post in this series, we'll explore how to design systems and processes that naturally encourage balanced reciprocity rather than enabling chronic taking or burning out your most generous team or community members.*
