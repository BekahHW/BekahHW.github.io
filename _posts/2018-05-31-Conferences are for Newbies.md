It's been a week since my first full, IRL conference, and my mind is still exploding. Special thanks to the wonderful organizers from [Revolution Conference](https://revolutionconf.com/) for the diversity ticket. Without it, I wouldn't have a renewed drive to learn as much as I can as fast as I can. I can't stop talking about how much I learned, hence this blog and the webinar--Chart your Territory: how to make the most out of your conference-- I'm giving June 7, 12:30EST. (I'll post the link when I have it.) But this post isn't about that; it's a list of my top five reasons newbies should attend conferences.

## Find your focus
I've been learning JavaScript since the fall, and I've really enjoyed its potential applications, but wow, was my mind blown by Guy Royse's talk [ML for Gamers: Dungeon Forecasts and Dragon Regressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4HJi4N1HsQ&t=11s). Up to this point, I knew little to nothing about ML, but now I know it needs to find a place in my life. His wasn't the only talk that helped me to see a larger world of tech. A number of other great talks helped me to understand subtleties and nuances I hadn't considered. I left the talks having a clearer focus of application.

## Find your mentors
A mentor doesn't have to be a life-long partner. A mentor can hand you the weapon you need with a couple of words of confidence and then send you on your way to slay the dragon. In the same way, a conference welcomes mentorship in every moment you have to network. Ask the people at your breakfast table about their favorite resources, stories, or experiences. I even got some great gardening mentorship. (Be prepared for a summer of tomatoes and carrots next to my laptop on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bekahhw/)).

## Find your people
I was incredibly lucky to meet a [Moms Can: Code](momscancode.com) member at the conference for the first time IRL. Together, we met a great group of women who were able to talk about the challenges we face as mothers or working while woman. I expanded my support network, and gained confidence by talking to women already in the field. And they rocked.

## Prepare yourself for job-seeking
I'm not at the point where I'm looking for a job, but that didn't mean I wasn't approached by recruiters. This was a no-stakes game for me and really good practice. The next conference I go to when I'm job-ready, I'll have a better idea of what to expect.

## It's a damn good time
I don't get out much, so this was the best time I've had in months. Even my fellow introverts came out to have a good time. One of the best parts was the openness and honesty they all brought to the table. We talked code, life, and living, and I feel like a better person after meeting them.

If you have the chance to conference, take it. If you can't afford it, don't forget about it. I could never have afforded the conference and travel, but I emailed the conference organizers to see if they had diversity tickets. And I was lucky enough to build community to sustain me when I'm frustrated, celebrate my successes, and laugh with me when I have no idea what I'm doing.
