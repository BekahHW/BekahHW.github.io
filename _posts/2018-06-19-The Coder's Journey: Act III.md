In this final post, we’ll see the hero make it to her end destination. She’s come through the hard part, working with her first client. Will she find it was worth it? Or will she forget everything she’s learned and return to her old life?

### The Resurrection
*The hero experiences a final moment of death and rebirth so they are pure when they reenter the ordinary world*

A week’s passed by. Our coder has proudly boasted her first job as a web developer to anyone and everyone. In line at the grocery store. On twitter. The officer who pulled her over for speeding. The Lowe’s delivery guy. And the list goes on.

But, suddenly, she gets a text from her client: The site’s not working.

*What?!?* She throws her coffee over her shoulder and takes off for the library across the street. She throws her stuff on a table, and dives into the site. *Don’t panic*, she mumbles under her breath. She clicks from tab to tab. Google searches.

Her client texts again: We need that online ASAP.

Looks at her watch. She’s been going at this for too long. But then it hits her. She types across the screen and...it works!!!

### Return with the Elixir
*The hero returns with something to improve the ordinary world*

Our coder sits at a picnic table at a park with three other moms. Kids play in the background.

Mom 1: So, what are you doing? Like medical coding?

Our coder smiles politely: I build things in computer language. Basically everything you do with a screen, I’m learning to do or can do already.

Mom 2: I have this really great idea for an app.

Our coder: Actually, I’m pretty booked up now. Between my personal project, blog, and the coding web course I’m developing to help people with PTSD, I can’t take on one more project, but I know some people.

And our coder is finally confident enough to take only the projects she wants and to focus on what's meaningful to her.
