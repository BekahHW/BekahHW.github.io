As of June 1st, I'm no longer with the Linux Foundation. While I'll share more details about this transition in a future post, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what comes next.

Going through an acquisition is intense, especially when you're leaving what was truly your favorite job. The experience has been both professionally enriching and personally challenging, and I've realized how important it is to give yourself permission to pause and process major changes rather than immediately jumping into the next thing.

So that's exactly what I'm doing this summer: taking a pragmatic approach to my career and family life. I'm giving myself time to breathe, to explore opportunities I didn't have bandwidth for before, and to be intentional about my next steps.

## What's Coming This Summer

My primary focus for the coming months will be diving deep into AI tools and their practical applications. I've been wanting to explore more AI tools, but I haven’t had the time to until now. As someone who's spent considerable time thinking about content strategy and audience development, I'm fascinated by how AI is reshaping not just what we create, but how we create it.

You can expect a lot of AI-related content from me in the weeks ahead. I don’t have an exact plan mapped out, so it might be everything from tool reviews and practical use cases to my thoughts on how these technologies are changing the content landscape. 

## Looking Forward

I'll have more to share about my long-term plans soon, but for now, I'm embracing this period of exploration. Thanks for following along on this journey. The next few months should be interesting.
