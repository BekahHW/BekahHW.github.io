title: "Moms Who Code"

---
There are stages of learning. There are stages of being part of a community. This morning I went back and reread my [blog post from last Mother’s Day](https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2018/05/09/I'm-a-Mother-Coder), and most of what I wrote still stands. So today I want to talk about something different. I want to talk about why coding is for moms.

I see so many moms trying to start a side hustle, and yes, I’ve gotten all the DMs. And no, I don’t need an exercise group, makeup, candles, jewelry, leggings, or someone to do my marketing. All of those are great for some people, but that’s not for me. I need something that allows me to be a life-long learner. I need something that allows me to grow. I need something that allows me to create things that can make moms’ lives easier or safer or that helps them to feel like part of a community. I need to be helping people. But I also want to be at home with my kids.

I want to be there when they have to go to the doctor. I want to be there when they have deep questions that need to be answered. I want to be there to comfort them when they fall. I want to hear my two-year-old giggle when my nine-year-old plays with her. I want a job that gives me flexibility.

If you went around and asked people about me the one thing that everyone throughout the entirety of my life would say about me is that I’m a hard-worker. I enjoy accomplishing things--maybe too much, but that’s another story. Working part-time or flexibly or remotely won’t change the fact that when I take on a job, I do it to the best of my ability. And I think that’s true of most moms.

We’re often left to carry the emotional weight of the family, care for our children and house, and cultivate our children’s dreams while advancing our own well-being, development, and dreams. And yes, a lot of times we’re tired. But we get it done. The further along I find myself on this coding journey, the more I realize that I can do it all while taking care of myself, and if no one is willing to let me do it all as part of their company, then I’ll just start my own. Imagine how beautiful it would be to have a community who understands your needs and is willing to be flexible, knowing that you will accomplish what you set out to do.

Moms, sometimes learning to code is hard, but being a mother is harder. Most of us have gone through things we never could’ve imagined before being a mother. We’re stronger. We’re more vulnerable. We’re determined. So the next time you get frustrated when you’re coding, remember that motherhood has put you through worse. You’ve got this.
