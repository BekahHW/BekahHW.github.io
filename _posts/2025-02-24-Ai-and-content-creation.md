title: "Google’s EEAT vs. Aristotle’s Rhetorical Triangle: SEO Is Just Ancient Rhetoric in Disguise"

Recently, I learned about Google’s EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) framework. That's the one that determines whether your content is worthy of showing up on search results or if it gets yeeted into the void of page two or beyond.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that EEAT is just Aristotle’s rhetorical triangle with an SEO-friendly name.

The humor isn't lost on me that same guy who spent his days philosophizing in ancient Greece (who I learned about in my Freshman Philosophy class) basically laid the groundwork for Google’s ranking algorithm. And if that doesn’t prove that everything in life is a remix, I don’t know what does.

But let’s break this down in a way that is useable for content creators.

## What Is EEAT?
In Google’s world, EEAT stands for:
- **Experience** – Have you actually done the thing you’re writing about?
- **Expertise** – Do you know your stuff?
- **Authoritativeness** – Are you recognized as a legit source?
- **Trustworthiness** – Can people rely on your content?

Basically, if you’re writing about deep-sea welding, Google wants to make sure you’re not my 10 year old who just watched a YouTube video about it and decided, “Yeah, I could generate a bunch words on this using ChatGPT.”

## Aristotle’s Rhetorical Triangle: The OG EEAT

Long before Google existed (or the internet, or electricity, or deodorant), Aristotle defined the three pillars of persuasion:
- **Ethos (Credibility)** – Are you a trustworthy source?
- **Pathos (Emotion)** – Can you connect with people’s lived experiences?
- **Logos (Logic)** – Do you have facts to back up what you’re saying?

Sound familiar? That’s because it’s basically EEAT in a different era.

Here’s how they match up:

| **EEAT (Google)**                          | **Aristotle’s Triangle**                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Experience** (Have you actually done this?) | **Pathos** (Can you connect with real-life experiences?) |
| **Expertise** (Do you understand the topic deeply?) | **Logos** (Do you have the knowledge and logic to back it up?) |
| **Authoritativeness & Trustworthiness** (Are you credible and reliable?) | **Ethos** (Are you a respected and believable source?) |

If Aristotle were alive today, he’d probably have a wildly successful blog, rank #1 on Google for How to Win an Argument, and be giving TED Talks about persuasion.

## SEO Is Just Rhetoric for the Internet Age

The more you think about it, the more it makes sense. Google isn’t just rewarding well-researched content; it’s rewarding persuasive content.

Just like Aristotle’s rhetoric, SEO is about:
- Knowing your audience (Google calls this “search intent”)
- Establishing credibility (Google calls this “authority”)
- Making a strong case (Google calls this “quality content”)

At the end of the day, writing for SEO is about being convincing, trustworthy, and valuable. Just like a good argument, or, a well-structured ancient Greek debate.

## What Does This Mean for You?

If you’re trying to write content that actually ranks, take a page from Google and Aristotle:
- Share real experiences. (People can smell fake authority from a mile away.)
- Back up your claims with solid knowledge. (Google loves receipts.)
- Build credibility over time. (Trust isn’t built in a day.)

But what's most important, in my opinion? Write for people. Be engaging. Tell a story. Drop a joke now and then. Because at the end of the day, whether you’re Aristotle in 350 BCE or a content creator in 2025, the best way to win people over is to be real, be knowledgeable, and make it worth their time.
