Hey! I graduated from the Flatiron School Software Engineering program in May of 2019, and since then I've been a front-end development and Team & Community Building consultant, created the developer community <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a>, and spent a lot of time educating, listening, and growing with the tech community. I'm currently the Developer Experience Lead at [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza/). I dabble in other things like podcasting, speaking at conferences, momming four kids, and occasionally live-streaming.

Prior to tech, I spent 10 years teaching college English, three years organizing events and community, and I fully embrace being a writer of many genres: code, short fiction, non-fiction, screenplay, documentation, curriculum, and, of course, blog posts!

As a hobby, I like to lift heavy things and see how high I can jump.

_Thanks for reading!_
