I"<p>It’s Preptember!!!! What does that even mean? <strong>Story time.</strong> Last year was the first year I had ever heard about Preptember. We, at <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a> were just starting to get ready to our first <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> together, and somewhere along the line, someone told us that September was coined Preptember as we prepared to go into Hacktoberfest. And in a lot of ways, for organizers, Preptember is even more work than Hacktoberfest. Because this is month that we prepare for all of our events, that we make sure we have support systems in place for our members, that we do the work to ensure that we’ve thought through every problem imaginable and we set everyone up for success.</p>
