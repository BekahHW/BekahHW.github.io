I"‹<p>Itâ€™s been a week since my first full, IRL conference, and my mind is still exploding. Special thanks to the wonderful organizers from <a href="https://revolutionconf.com/">Revolution Conference</a> for the diversity ticket. Without it, I wouldnâ€™t have a renewed drive to learn as much as I can as fast as I can. I canâ€™t stop talking about how much I learned, hence this blog and the webinarâ€“Chart your Territory: how to make the most out of your conferenceâ€“ Iâ€™m giving June 7, 12:30EST. (Iâ€™ll post the link when I have it.) But this post isnâ€™t about that; itâ€™s a list of my top five reasons newbies should attend conferences.</p>
