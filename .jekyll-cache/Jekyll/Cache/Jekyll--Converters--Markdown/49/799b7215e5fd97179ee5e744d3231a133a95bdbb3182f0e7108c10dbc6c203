I"£<p>When we were working on the <a href="https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss">Intro to Open Source</a> course, one of the biggest painpoints we noted with new contributors was the frustration they felt when their PRs werenâ€™t merged in in what they felt was a reasonable amount of time. They had done their research, found an issue, gotten assigned, and thenâ€¦nothing. No feedback. No merge. Just silence.</p>
