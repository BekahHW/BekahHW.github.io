I"j<p>Over the past couple of years, I’ve been in the middle of conversations about whether or not DevRel belongs in marketing. At the end of the day, I don’t know that it matters if you understand developers. One of the biggest pain points I’ve seen from marketing teams is understanding how to talk to developers, because, as we all know, developers are highly sensitive to feeling like they’ve been “marketed to.” What that really means is that they have high standards for the content they consume. Developers want to know that you understand the information. They want precision, depth, and utility.</p>
