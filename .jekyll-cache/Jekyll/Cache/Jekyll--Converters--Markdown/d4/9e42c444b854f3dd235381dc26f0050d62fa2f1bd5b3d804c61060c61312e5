I"k<p>I’ve been trying to understand Ruby object relationships for a while now. And generally, I have a grasp on what that means, but I still spend a lot of time figuring out what belongs to who and who has many of what. And then my brain starts to spin. But then I came across this <a href="https://medium.com/@marcellamaki/object-relationships-in-basic-ruby-1af5773fff48">article</a>, which spells it out really nicely. So to practice my understanding of the concepts, I came up with a parallel example. Instead of a cinema, I’m going to take you through a library, since I’m sitting in the library right now.</p>
