I"§<p>Itâ€™s almost been a year since Virtual Coffee was born from my cry of desperation into the Twittersphere. From knowing that I couldnâ€™t let myself be isolated during the time the world was calling for isolation. I knew from my experience with trauma four years ago that <em>I</em> needed community to get me through this, even though Iâ€™m shy and an introvert and that reaching out into the Twitter void and opening myself up at this most vulnerable moment was terrifying. And now on this 100th Coffee, Iâ€™m going to talk about what Iâ€™ve learned just from those zoom sessionsâ€“Iâ€™ll save the rest of the things Iâ€™ve learned for the one-year Virtual Coffee post.</p>
