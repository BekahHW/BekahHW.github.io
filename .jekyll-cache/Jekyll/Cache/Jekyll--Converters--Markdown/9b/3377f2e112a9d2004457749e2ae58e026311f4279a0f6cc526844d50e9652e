I"â<p>In <a href="https://bekahhw.com/Taking-Time-to-Breathe-A-New-Chapter-Begins">my last post</a>, I talked about spending time this summer looking at different AI tools. I want to get hands-on, figure out what I want to integrate into my workflow. But before I spend time (and money) testing things out, I wanted to start with the free/trial periods. So youâ€™re starting at the beginning of this journey with me. The question that I started with is: Which AI code assistants will actually let me take them for a proper test drive? In this post, Iâ€™ll share what I found across five top AI Coding Assistantsâ€”Continue, Windsurf, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Tabnineâ€”and what Iâ€™m interested in learning as I put them to the test.</p>
