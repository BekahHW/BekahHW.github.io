I"é<p>Iâ€™ve adjuncted in a university English Department for the last ten years, and it took learning to code to realize that adjuncting was a dead-end job. In January, I took an accelerated bootcamp prep online for a couple of weeks. After that bootcamp, my perspective on education, my future, and my own capabilities changed. So in the middle of a <a href="www.momscancode.com">Moms Can: Code</a> virtual co-working session, I emailed my department chair to tell him I wouldnâ€™t be returning. It wasnâ€™t just about the politics of academia, the lack of upward mobility, the no merit-based raises in the entire time I was there. Yes, that was part of it, but I needed to value myself and my time. My experience isnâ€™t unique to academia.</p>
