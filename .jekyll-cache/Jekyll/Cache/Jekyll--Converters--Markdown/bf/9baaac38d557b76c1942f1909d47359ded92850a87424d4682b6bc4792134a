I"¤<p>I <em>like</em> my comfort zone. A lot. Itâ€™s a familiar space. Itâ€™s a warm blanket, a cup of coffee, in front of a fire. Itâ€™s the crack of the bat against a baseball on a hot July day. Itâ€™s hearing that song from when I was eleven and still knowing all the words. I think comfort zones are good, but pushing ourselves out of them, pushing ourselves into unknown territories, those are the places we grow.</p>
