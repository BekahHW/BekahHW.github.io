I"Ÿ<p>Itâ€™s been a year since Iâ€™ve started coding. December 6th is my one year GitHub-iversary, and December 11th, is my six month anniversary with Flatiron School. Itâ€™s amazing to reflect on the last year and all Iâ€™ve learned and the communities that Iâ€™ve found around me. Iâ€™ve found people who support me, make me laugh, and listen to me when Iâ€™m frustrated or when I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™ve found a new passion for a journey I never expected to takeâ€“a beautiful new world that I am so excited to explore. In honor of these anniversaries, Iâ€™ve come up with my top ten list of things Iâ€™ve learned and found meaningful as a Code Newbie.</p>
