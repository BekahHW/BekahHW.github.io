I"v<p>The thing about trauma is, it doesn’t stick to your timeline. The thing about trauma is, when you think you’re done with it, it creeps back in. The thing about trauma is, you find yourself in constant fight or flight and you second guess every single decision you make and whether or not you’re too much for the people in your life. You wonder if you’re overreacting. You wonder if the people you call your friends will stop being your friends because that’s all you can focus on. You wonder if you will always feel alone. The thing about trauma is, even when you have worked so fucking hard, it still creeps up.</p>
