I"x<p>Yep, I love puns. I probably love them more than I love coding, but that’s because I’ve spent my last ten years as an adjunct English instructor. Actually, I think that I really enjoyed learning some Solidity because of that background. Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve jumped from JavaScript to learning more about Crypto, specifically Ethereum and Solidity.</p>
