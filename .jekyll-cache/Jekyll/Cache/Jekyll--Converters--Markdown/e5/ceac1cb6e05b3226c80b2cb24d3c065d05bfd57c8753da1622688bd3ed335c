I"í<p>For my first solo project with Flatiron School, I had to create a CLI Ruby Gem where I scraped data from a website and went at least one level deep. Because Iâ€™m still in this weird space where I feel like I donâ€™t know anything even though Iâ€™ve learned a lot over the past 232 days that Iâ€™ve coded, I was a little terrified to take a step toward my project. Luckily, my mentor messaged me about doing a video chat, and she got me going. But then I needed to do some mapping out.</p>
