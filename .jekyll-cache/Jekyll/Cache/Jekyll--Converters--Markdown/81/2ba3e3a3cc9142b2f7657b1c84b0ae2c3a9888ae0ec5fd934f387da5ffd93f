I"ì<p>Iâ€™m close to completing my first year on a Developer Relations team. As I evaluate my own performance over the last year and set goals for my next year as a Technical Community Builder, I wanted to share how Iâ€™ve broken down my self-evaluation and goal setting. I donâ€™t think you need to be on a DevRel team to find this useful. Based off of my responses to these questions, Iâ€™d like to work on creating self-evaluation points and put them in my calender during the next year.</p>
