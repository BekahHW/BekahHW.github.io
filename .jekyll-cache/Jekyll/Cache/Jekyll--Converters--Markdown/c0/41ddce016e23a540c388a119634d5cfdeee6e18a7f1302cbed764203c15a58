I"à<p>Iâ€™m only 5â€™1 and Â¾.  Thatâ€™s right, when youâ€™re short, you count that Â¾. Nothingâ€™s going to change the fact that Iâ€™ve been this height since I was 11.  Apparently, though, some people think my height isnâ€™t the only â€œshortâ€ thing about me.</p>

<p>I recently attended a webinar by some awesome reps of coding bootcamps/schools and asked the question: Is it worth it for a mom of four kids under nine to go through an intensive and expensive bootcamp if Iâ€™m only looking for PT or contract work when Iâ€™m done? The man who responded was incredibly positive, talking about moms as hard workers, goal-driven, and badasses. He finished with, donâ€™t sell yourself short; you can be a great mom and work full time. I appreciated his positivity, but that last comment rubbed my short body the wrong way.</p>

<p>As a working mom, Iâ€™m not selling myself short by wanting to code PT or pick up contract work. Hereâ€™s why:</p>

<p><b>Part-time Workâ€¦</b></p>
<ul> <li>!= part-time passion;</li>
<li>!= part-time skill;</li>
<li>Encourages diversity;</li>
<li>Isnâ€™t second-class work;</li>
<li>Allows PT employees to be just as invested in the mission and goals of the organization as FT employees;</li>
<li>Creates options. Moms know whatâ€™s best for them and their families;</li>
<li>Can increase <a href="http://doku.iab.de/discussionpapers/2017/dp2017.pdf#page=5">employee satisfaction</a>;</li>
<li>Creates flexibility for the employer and the employee;</li>
<li>Allows for a greater work-life balance for primary caretakers;</li>
<li>Lets me be the badass I am.</li></ul>

<p>Part-time workers are less valuable only when employers donâ€™t respect or invest in their part-time workers. Right now in higher ed, weâ€™re on the brink of radical changes because colleges and universities <a href="https://www.adjunctnation.com/2017/03/27/of-course-tenured-faculty-are-responsible-for-the-adjunct-crisis/">donâ€™t invest in their part-time/contract adjunct faculty</a>. This is obviously not the model that tech should pick up. If the tech community wants to be inclusive, they must include and value the part-time employee. This part-time employee may be short in height, but Iâ€™m definitely not short on passion, determination, and diligence.</p>
