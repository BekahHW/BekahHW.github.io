I"–<p>Some weeks, you‚Äôll have a lot of tangible checkmarks on your to-do list. Other weeks, it feels like you haven‚Äôt done anything. Still, in reality, you‚Äôve spent a lot of time planning for things in the future, thinking deliberately‚Äìrather than just reacting‚Äìabout the people in your community, their needs, and how you can support them as the community builder for your own community. This is one of those weeks for me.</p>

<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<p>I still got my blog posts in. We‚Äôre announcing the winners of the Deepgram + Learn Build Teach Hackathon, and I added to my Reading List series with a post on <a href="https://dev.to/bekahhw/reading-list-the-community-builder-edition-3d2h">Community Builders Resources</a>.</p>

<h2 id="live-events">Live Events</h2>
<p>I went for two this week, with a Twitter Space with Julia Seidman, ‚ÄúDeveloper Growth: Writing to Learn‚Äù and a livestream working through adding Cypress to a React Application for a blog post that will come out later this month. I‚Äôve been working on building a practice of creating content and repurposing it. And that‚Äôs been on my mind this week as I did these live events. I may write a post with the takeaways of the Twitter Space, but for now, you can see <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepgramAI/status/1590402513488203777?s=20&amp;t=oiC2XyLeYyHboxBvGDo7yA">my notes</a> in the Twitter thread from the space. (If you‚Äôve seen any cool ways to reuse Twitter Space content, I‚Äôd love to know!)</p>

<h2 id="processes-and-planning">Processes and Planning</h2>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I‚Äôve talked about a content creation lifecyle. Here‚Äôs what I mean by that:</p>

<p>Say you want to publish a tutorial. The end goal of the content creation lifecycle would be to end up with a video, written tutorial, code snippets, Twitter thread and maybe a Space, live demo, and a short-form video. The video might be a livestream of you implementing what you‚Äôll be writing about for the tutorial‚Äìbut it‚Äôs something you can definitely link to. From that video, you can clip for your short-form video (YouTube, Instagram Reels, tiktok, etc.). You can even transcribe the video to help write the blog post and the Twitter Thread. Finally, that code gets put into stackblitz or codepen so users can test it out live.</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt nailed that process quite yet because of the pace we‚Äôre going in other things, but I keep thinking, ‚ÄúWhat about the community?‚Äù For me, so much of the content that I create is to build community. I write for myself, but I love when it means that I get to engage with others and hear their thoughts on what I‚Äôm writing about. Where does the community fit into the content creation lifecycle? We have to find ways to make space for those in our community to be a part of this conversation. Because that‚Äôs the content I want to produce; the kind of content that creates conversation.</p>

<p>Part of my planning and thinking deliberately about this included using Twitter Spaces to extend the conversation. What have I started talking about? How can I continue this conversation with interested people? Can I repurpose Twitter Spaces to be a blog post? Sure. They can extend the conversation from both angles.</p>

<p>But how else can we extend the conversation? Well, we can do things the old-fashioned way and have a face-to-face conversation. Why not have a small group discussion about the topic or a workshop if it‚Äôs a tutorial? Interact with the community in ways that are meaningful to them.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm ideating on the best way to do this and ensuring I‚Äôm not building an echo chamber. I want to find more ways to listen to others and learn from each other. To do this properly, however, requires quite a bit of planning, and it always feels like there‚Äôs not enough time in the day to do that.</p>

<p>One way I‚Äôm ensuring my planning time happens is committing to time away from the computer and phone to think things through. Write them down on notebook paper, and remove the distractions of slack, email, Twitter, etc. And since I work from home, it‚Äôs also important to remove the distractions of laundry, kids, and the bills sitting on my desk.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to try to commit to one morning or afternoon a week outside of the home without device distractions. I‚Äôve tried this before on Friday afternoons because I thought it would help me to disconnect from work for the weekend, but then I ended up feeling like there were too many loose ends to wrap up, and I couldn‚Äôt turn work off. For now, I‚Äôll play it by ear and find a good two to three-hour time period where I can be afk.</p>

<p>Another part of the planning process I worked on this week was community campaigns. It might seem like creating simple discussion posts doesn‚Äôt require that much time, but if you want to weave a story of information, listen to what the community wants and needs, and create plans to act on those wants and needs, you have to research and create space for meaningful conversations with consistency. A lot of times that means building out posts ahead of time and implementing them when the situation is right.</p>

<p>As I build out these processes and think more holistically about all the things that I‚Äôm creating, I want to find a way to make this a smooth and repeatable process. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve thought deeply about, but I hope that as I build in time to think through these things, I‚Äôll be able to share more about that here. And that we can maybe even have a conversation about it.</p>
