I"<p>I’m a middle child through and through. I spent my childhood competing with my older brother. I think he could’ve cared less, but I spent my free time reading the same books he was reading two grades ahead of me, studying for Algebra tests so I could get a better grade than him, pushing myself to exceed all expectations of what I should be doing. As an adult, I found out that this “competitive spirit” was not exactly my finest trait, and that it was better if I focused on doing things for me. I could compete with myself, and that was ok. I could prove to myself that I could exceed my own rational expectations. But when my organs ruptured, all of my confidence was sucked out of me. Apparently, the doctors removed my self-confidence with my uterus, because I felt like I wasn’t good enough to do anything. My mind was broken. My body was broken. My spirit was broken. Coding helped to bring that back to me to a degree, but just before graduation, that lack of confidence was starting to control me again.</p>
