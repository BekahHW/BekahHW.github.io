I"ú<p>I go through phases of information consumption. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was tech podcasts all the time. Then it was audiobooks, mostly self-help kind of stuff. Now itâ€™s a mix of audiobooks, podcasts, and YouTube videos of all different genres. But sprinkled in there has been a variety of Community Building books and Resources. Iâ€™m going to use the word â€œReading Listâ€ loosely here in place of a resource list, as I give you some of my favorites over the past couple of years.</p>
