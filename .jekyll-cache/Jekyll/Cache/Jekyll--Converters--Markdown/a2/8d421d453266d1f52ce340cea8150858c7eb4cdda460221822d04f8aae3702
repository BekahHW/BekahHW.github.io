I"™<p>Iâ€™ve been doing virtual coffee for about a month now, and I couldnâ€™t have predicted how much I would look forward to the days that I get to talk to other devs. Hereâ€™s the thing, Iâ€™m a shy introvert, but I can flip to extrovert in the right situation. Iâ€™ve always loved conferencing, but there have been enough experiences where Iâ€™ve felt defeated because I was overwhelmed by the conference experience and my inability to initiate conversation and didnâ€™t meet anyone new. But for whatever reason, with virtual experiences I donâ€™t feel the pressure and the emotional burnout that I do when conferences are more challenging for my personality.</p>
