I"Œ<p>My notes from the last two weeks of Twitter spaces I hosted. These are not all my ideas, and I might not agree with them all. But, I wanted to share what we talked about.</p>

<h1 id="community--career">Community + Career</h1>

<h2 id="why-should-you-be-a-part-of-a-community">Why should you be a part of a community?*</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Helps with career guidance</li>
  <li>Supports you as you grow</li>
  <li>Allows for networking opportunities</li>
  <li>Creates a safe space for exploring new ideas and industries</li>
  <li>
    <p>Provides opportunities to help others</p>
  </li>
  <li>As always, this depends on the community you join. Not all experiences will be the same for all people.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="find-the-community-that-supports-its-members">Find the community that supports its members</h2>

<p>When you‚Äôre looking to join a community, here are some signs that the community supports its members:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authentic and vulnerable relationships and interactions,</li>
  <li>Investment in helping each other to grow -&gt; look at how people are answering questions or if help and support posts are mostly answered,</li>
  <li>Openness to new ideas and experiences -&gt; are members testing out new ideas or actions? Do you see people saying they‚Äôve done something for the first time as part of that group?</li>
  <li>Supportive communities can provide a space for you to try new things. For example, maybe you‚Äôre interested in speaking at a conference, but you‚Äôre afraid. If you have a supportive community, it‚Äôs easier to try out the experience. Give your presentation to the community and ask for feedback. When you have a supportive community, it‚Äôs easier to be open to feedback, to learn from the experience, and to work towards your goal of giving a presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-find-the-right-communities">How to find the right communities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure they have a code of conduct, esp if you‚Äôre part of an under-represented group</li>
  <li>They all you to be a passive member of a community -&gt; soak up the knowledge and experience</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="signs-of-a-positive-community">Signs of a positive community</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There‚Äôs a Code of Conduct</li>
  <li>For non-discord platforms, when people use their real names</li>
  <li>Members of under-represented groups</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="remote-work">Remote Work</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Some companies did even better when they were forced to go remote</li>
  <li>You can do the same thing from home that you can do in the office</li>
  <li>PPl are forming networks and relationships outside of the office as a result. There‚Äôs less glue, holding you to stick in the current position.</li>
  <li>You don‚Äôt have the opportunities to network outside of the office</li>
  <li>Remote and COVID-remote are two very different things. There are a lot of extra outside stressors. Remote was being thrust on ppl rather than a decision people made.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-work-in-a-physical-office">Why work in a physical office?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Some people prefer to work in the office</li>
  <li>Extrovert!</li>
  <li>Clear physical lines of communication: You can walk to the person‚Äôs office if you have a question.</li>
  <li>Sometimes a challenge of getting work done</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs a different type of productivity -&gt; talking with the people around you allows you to develop relationships more quickly.</li>
  <li>You build teams much quicker in the office</li>
  <li>Community building is easier.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="positives-of-working-remotely">Positives of working remotely</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Flexibility, especially for parents</li>
  <li>Allows parents to take breaks and spend time with their kids</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt have to commute</li>
  <li>Allows for productive breaks -&gt; You can start the laundry, dinner, do errands</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="navigating-challenges-of-working-remotely">Navigating challenges of working remotely</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt have a designated office space, it can be a challenge, but if you set boundaries</li>
  <li>Set rules for yourself: when to log off. Turn off the computer and don‚Äôt touch it</li>
  <li>Do a full shutdown every night</li>
  <li>Separate work and ‚Äúhome‚Äù computer, so there‚Äôs no drive to work after work hours</li>
  <li>Set a hard limit for work hours</li>
  <li>Dealing with stress and the easy access to food</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Normalize kid noises in the back of every meeting</li>
  <li>Productivity: there‚Äôs kind of no middle ground. There‚Äôs ppl who are super productive and not productive at all. This might speak to the type of office-environment that works best for you.</li>
  <li>We shouldn‚Äôt be micromanaging. Daily standup, project tracking, and milestones are enough to evaluated the productivity of the team.</li>
  <li>Forcing extra steps to force ppl to report progress, that‚Äôs toxic.</li>
  <li>If there‚Äôs an issue with a person, approach it as ‚ÄúHow can we support you? Is there a challenge I can help you with?‚Äù</li>
  <li>Developers should have autonomy and support</li>
  <li>Over-communication &gt; under-communication</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt do remote work on vacation!!!</li>
  <li>Team-building remotely: Depending on the team, turn on the cameras, hear the voice of the other person</li>
  <li>Whole set of problems returning to office spaces now with mice, etc.</li>
</ul>
