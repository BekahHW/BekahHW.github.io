I"ü<p>Iâ€™m generally a visual or visual-kinesthetic learner. I think thatâ€™s one of the reasons I really enjoy learning with <a href="flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>. Thereâ€™s a lot of reading material, code alongs, and labs. There are some videos and supplementary videos, but the main source of learning is visual and kinesthetic. And Iâ€™ve become really comfortable doing all of these things. But this week, I started something new: walking someone else through my code. It. Was. Terrifying.</p>
