I"%<p>I’ve had this dream for a while to write a collaborative screenplay. Not a screenplay with a partner. I’ve already done that with my brother a couple of times. A collaborative project would allow multiple writers, editors, and experts in different parts of the screenplay (character arc, dialogue, audience experience to work on the project). I know what you’re thinking, and yes, this could turn out to be a hodge podge, disastrous script. But hear me out. I think this could work if we understood it in the context of git and GitHub.</p>
