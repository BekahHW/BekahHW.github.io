I"F<p>At the end of last year, my brothers and I wrote our first novel together (<a href="https://dub.sh/b4c-astro">The Battle for Christmas: Reign of the Nutcrackers</a>). That experience inspired us to continue writing together, starting with a monthly newsletter with short stories. At this point, we decided we wanted a website. We had been using <a href="https://kit.com/">Kit</a> to send emails, and we liked that functionality, but as our writing resumes grow, we also wanted to have a place where people could see all of our work, and this is where our Astro site came in.</p>
