I"Ã<p>Virtual Coffee has been through a progression of announcements about who we are and what we do. And weâ€™re very thankful for the people who have shared when we get it wrong. One of the times weâ€™ve gotten it wrong was when we included the phrase â€œassume best intent.â€ We wanted everyone to assume that we all supported each other, saw each other with an equal lens, and wanted the best for each other. And while that would be great, the truth is that it doesnâ€™t always happen. Iâ€™m thankful that one of our members pointed it out to us, and Iâ€™m sorry if using that phrase negatively impacted any of our members without us knowing. Weâ€™ve since updated our language, and we ask that everyone â€œlead with kindness, and recognize that the impact of our words matters.â€ We share our Code of Conduct and our Code of Conduct violation form to ensure that thereâ€™s a clear space for folks to share their experiences where they didnâ€™t feel safe.</p>
