I"Æ<p>Iâ€™m at a red light, but my mindâ€™s not there. Itâ€™s back in the hospital, remembering the doctor saying â€œthatâ€™s strange.â€ Iâ€™m in the grocery store, but my mindâ€™s not there. Itâ€™s in the doctorâ€™s office, hearing the doctor say â€œYouâ€™re not my problem.â€ Iâ€™m playing with my kids, but my mindâ€™s not there. Itâ€™s seeing the seven or eight inch frankenstein scar for the first time. Itâ€™s feeling the first time standing after surgery. Itâ€™s crying in my bedroom. Itâ€™s me saying, I canâ€™t do this. I canâ€™t do this. Itâ€™s on repeat. Over and over and over. Everyday for months.</p>

<p>For a long time, I thought this was normal, but then my counselor told me I had PTSD. For months of my life, I was reliving a trauma constantly in my brain. No wonder I was exhausted. I was on Paxil to stop the panic attacks that started after the surgery to repair the vesicouterine fistulaâ€“a tunnel formed between the bladder and uterusâ€“that occurred while delivering my fourth child. The Paxil worked for my panic attacks but not the PTSD. The counseling helped me to realize some subconscious feelings I had, but my life was a constant replay of the month long trauma, and the six month recovery. But then I started coding.</p>

<p>When I was coding, I was focused. My brain was immersed in learning a new skill. When I was coding, it was all I could think about. Surprisingly, errors were even a welcome distraction in the beginning. Not getting my code right the first time forced me to go line by line and try to figure out what was causing the error. There was no room for distraction, and nothing about coding reminded me about the trauma I had faced. Not only did coding take all my focus, but it also became something I really enjoyed.</p>

<p>Because thereâ€™s a visual aspect to coding, I was able to see what my work produced. I was creating something new, and I liked that. I found a wonderful community, and a pretty supportive group of people on twitter. I enjoyed learning a new skill along with other people, and it was challenging. I enjoy taking on what seem to be impossible tasks, and at this point in my lifeâ€“mother of four with major mental traumaâ€“this seemed like a pretty impossible task. Knowing this wasnâ€™t something I could accomplish in a day, and that in a year there would be something new for me to learn, drew me in. This would be a life-long learning process, and I was pretty pumped about that.</p>

<p>One of the things that surprised me the most about coding, was that I gained a confidence I hadnâ€™t had in a really long time. I donâ€™t make progress everyday, but as long as Iâ€™m committed and trying, I feel good about what I did that day. Coding has redefined who I am. People donâ€™t ask me how I am with that sad look on their face anymore. They ask me how coding is going, and Iâ€™m happy to talk about it. Not only am I happy about what Iâ€™ve achieved so farâ€“so happy, in fact, that I quit my adjuncting job so I can code insteadâ€“but Iâ€™m really happy to help others get involved as well. This is one of the reasons Iâ€™ve decided to become a coding coach; itâ€™s why I encouraged my teenage cousin to apply for the <a href="kodewithklossy.com">Kode with Klossy camp</a>; itâ€™s why I answer DMs on twitter.</p>

<p>I still have days and weeks where my PTSD is triggered, and I have a hard time functioning, but Iâ€™ve realized that a little humilityâ€“asking for help isnâ€™t one of my strengthsâ€“and focus on something I love can go a long way in helping me to redefine myself away from my trauma. This wonâ€™t be the same journey for everyone, and this is definitely not medical advice, but Iâ€™m thankful that I had people in my life who encouraged me to start and stick with this journey.</p>
