I"Ô<p>I get a lot of messages on social media asking me about coding, what it is, how to get started, whether or not to do a bootcamp, and where to get started. The truth is we are all the hero in our individual journeys. What worked for Frodo wouldnâ€™t work for Veronica Mars, and what worked for her wouldnâ€™t work for someone else. But there are parts of each of our journeys that will overlap. And in the moments that they overlap, I can give you some insight.</p>
