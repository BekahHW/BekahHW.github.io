I"„<p>Iâ€™m the type of person who judges a book by its cover. (I know, Iâ€™m a college English teacher, I should know better. But I can tell you from experience that there are some awesome books with awesome covers. Case in point: Iâ€™m reading the kids <a href="https://johnaugust.com/arlo-finch">Arlo Finch</a> right now.) When youâ€™re learning to code, it can be difficult to understand what youâ€™re actually doing. Like, what if Iâ€™m importing that object. What does it look like when I do that?!? Not everything will have a visual representation, but itâ€™s helpful to think about how the pieces work together to create what you see.</p>
