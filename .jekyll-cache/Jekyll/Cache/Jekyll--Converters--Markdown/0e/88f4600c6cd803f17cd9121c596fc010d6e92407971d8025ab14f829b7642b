I"<p>A couple of days ago, I saw <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeromehardaway_microsoft-ceo-admits-that-ai-is-generating-activity-7340817881154134016-Ld9Q">Jerome Hardaway’s LinkedIn post</a>, and it really resonated with me. I like the idea of thinking of AI coding tools as “really great intern[s]. Fast, helpful, capable in the right hands – but still needs supervision, clear direction, and someone to clean up afterward.” There are a couple of projects that I’m working on this summer: the author site that I share with my brothers that uses Astro, a new project I’m launching for <a href="https://oss-communities.netlify.app/">osscommunities.com</a>. This seems like the perfect opportunity to find the right tool that’s worth adding tool to my workflow.</p>
