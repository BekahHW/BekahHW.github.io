I"§<p>Everyoneâ€™s experience in bootcamp is different, but every bootcamp graduate Iâ€™ve talked toâ€“whether itâ€™s been a full-time intense bootcamp, remote self-paced, or anything in betweenâ€“have all admitted that the commitment was incredibly stressful. For most of us, weâ€™re changing careers and balancing other things like jobs, relationships, family, and, yes, even sometimes, a social life. But learning to code takes all of your focus and your energy, and puts you in a high-stress environment for as long as youâ€™re learning. And sometimes I forget to mention that when I talk about how great it was.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t have people in your life who are understanding, itâ€™s going to add a greater challenge. To be fully transparent, when my husband was career-changing five and a half years ago and told me he needed to take this course and spend his extra time learning a thing called â€œReact,â€ I wasnâ€™t exactly supportive. I didnâ€™t know what that meant. I was pregnant with my third kid, and for the life of me, I could not understand how this would help our family in the long run. Heâ€™d try to explain, but I knew nothing about coding. So nothing he said made any sense at all. Iâ€™ll be honest here, there was a lot of resentment. And it wasnâ€™t until he landed his first full-time dev job that I understand the opportunities that this gave him and how it would positively impact our future.</p>

<p>So I was really fortunate to go to bootcamp and have a spouse that understood the challenges of learning to code, finding yourself experiencing the â€œdark night of the soulâ€ moment, every third day, and wanting to do nothing but learn to code in all your free moments. But he understood, because he had been there before. In some ways, thatâ€™s a luxury. Not everyone has that.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s exhausting to spend hours trying to learn something new. Yes, youâ€™ve been sitting at a computer all day. No, you havenâ€™t been swinging kettlebells or running a marathon, but you will still be exhausted. And youâ€™ll be frustrated with yourself for not remembering what you understood yesterday. And, if youâ€™re like me, youâ€™ll be cranky when you just canâ€™t get it. Youâ€™ll be emotionally spent after trying to figure out this coding puzzle youâ€™ve been working on.</p>

<p>Learning to code doesnâ€™t just challenge your brain, it fully challenges <em>you</em>. You might lose friends or relationships. You might hear people ask over and over again, â€œ<em>Why</em> are you doing this?â€ You might even cry.</p>

<p>When I talk about how great bootcamp is or how Iâ€™ve had amazing opportunities because of bootcamp, itâ€™s not that I intentionally leave out the part about how emotionally exhausting and stressful it is. Itâ€™s that the breath of fresh air that I breathed in the moment I started to actually feel like a developer makes that seem like a far-off memory. Iâ€™m going to try harder to tell prospective bootcampers about the challenges along with the opportunities, so they donâ€™t feel so alone in those moments where it feels like one tiny thing can cause everything around you to shatter.</p>

<p>Coming out of this experience helped to form me into a person that Iâ€™m proud of. Iâ€™ve been honest about my experience before bootcamp. My mental health was not in the best shape. Coding helped me to get to a place where I was mentally healthy because I learned how strong I was. I learned that I could get through trauma, that I am smart, that I can get through challenges piled on top of challenges, that I could still mom my four kids and make good decisions for my family, <em>and</em> I could find a job that was flexible and supportive and could help me be the best person I could be.</p>
