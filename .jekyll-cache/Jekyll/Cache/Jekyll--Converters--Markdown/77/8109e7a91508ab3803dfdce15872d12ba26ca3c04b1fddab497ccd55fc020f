I"T<p>I’ve been a dev for six months. Most days, I still think I’m going to get fired. I think I’m not good enough. I think I should know more. But that’s kind of my MO. I always think I’m not doing as well as I should be doing. It is not a reflection on the people I work with or anyone around me. It’s how I push myself. There are some days where the self-doubt is worse than others. Those are usually the days where I spend hours trying to track down what exactly is going on with this code I’m working on. And there are other days where I remind myself of how far I’ve come.</p>
