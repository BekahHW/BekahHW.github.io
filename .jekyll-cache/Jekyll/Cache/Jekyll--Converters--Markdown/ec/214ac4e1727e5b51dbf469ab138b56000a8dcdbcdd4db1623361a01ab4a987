I"ž<p>A friend recently asked me if I am a results or a process person. I told her that Iâ€™m a momentum person. I like to move. I donâ€™t like breaks. But when we hit the one year mark of <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a>, and I realized that I hadnâ€™t had a week off in a year I didnâ€™t <em>want</em> to take time off, but I thought I probably <em>should</em>. And it was the right call.</p>
