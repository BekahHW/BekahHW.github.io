I"<p>Last week, we wrapped up our second season of the Virtual Coffee (VC) Podcast with our <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/0209-season-two-wrapup/">Code and Community episode</a>. As VC‚Äôs been growing over the last year, I‚Äôve been working on the Virtual Coffee model for communities, and <a href="https://twitter.com/danieltott">Dan</a> and I have spent a lot of time talking through navigating the challenges and creating a direction for our unique community with the support and care of the community.</p>

<p>But I was especially inspired to write a highlight version of the episode when I saw Lucia‚Äôs tweet.</p>

Listen for their view on metrics, community building, and purpose. <a href="https://t.co/4FyYJhafO7">https://t.co/4FyYJhafO7</a></p>&mdash; Lucia Cerchie ü¶é (@CerchieLucia) <a href="https://twitter.com/CerchieLucia/status/1400135495984709632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>These are my top takeaways from this episode:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have so many ideas for the community, but there aren‚Äôt enough hours in the day to work on them all. We‚Äôre doing our best to prioritize them.</li>
  <li>We‚Äôre more than a slack of people who do meetups, events, and more. We‚Äôre ‚Äúan intimate community for all devs, optimized for you.‚Äù</li>
  <li>The face-to-face conversations are a key part of our identity. And it‚Äôs important to us that we keep our breakout rooms small to allow opportunities for everyone to join in the conversation.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs easier to stretch and grow when you know you have the support of the community.</li>
  <li>We‚Äôre inspired by the book <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/"><em>Radical Candor</em></a>! Clear and honest communication are important tools for trust and growth.</li>
  <li>We think of Virtual Coffee as an open source community.</li>
  <li>Building deliberately and creating structures and processes to empower members to help takes time.</li>
  <li>We‚Äôre never going to put content behind a paywall.</li>
  <li>Tooling with a team can be really expensive, and it‚Äôs challenging to find services that allow people to help when you have a small community and no funding .</li>
  <li>The goal of the Virtual Coffee Model is to have a lasting impact on your community, to create ripples that extend far beyond your community.</li>
  <li>So much of community tooling is based on making money off our your members. Since that‚Äôs not our goal, it‚Äôs been challenging to find a good fit.</li>
  <li>As community leadership, you can see each person individually and you can recognize them, but if you don‚Äôt have support in the tools, in the structures, you‚Äôre not going to get very far.</li>
  <li>Traditional community metrics leave a lot of people out. We value each member participating in the ways that are most comfortable for them.</li>
  <li>Our focus isn‚Äôt to grow <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a>, it‚Äôs to support our members.</li>
