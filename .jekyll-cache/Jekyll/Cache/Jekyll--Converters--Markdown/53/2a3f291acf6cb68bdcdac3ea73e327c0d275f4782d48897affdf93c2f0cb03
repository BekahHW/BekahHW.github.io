I"Ì<p>I‚Äôll admit, when I started taking my Rails project and adding JavaScript, it broke my heart a little. I loved where I had left off and I had big plans for how to expand it. I could see it all in my mind. But I know it‚Äôs never productive to be precious with your work. The second reservation that I had was JavaScript wasn‚Äôt exactly clicking. And what I mean by that is I could execute JS if someone told me, but I wasn‚Äôt conceptually understanding it. Why would I use this? Where would I use this? I kept waiting for it to click, and it kept not clicking. Because I had made it through the lessons and sought outside resources, I decided I should just jump in. The problem with jumping in when you don‚Äôt know exactly where you‚Äôre going, is that you just kind of put your finger on the map and say, ‚Äúthis looks like a good place to start‚Äù with no context as to whether that nice looking spot on the map is really a suitable place. And my finger landed on a join model, UserDisorder.</p>
