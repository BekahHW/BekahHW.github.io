I"Ø<p>Move fast and break things. You hear that a lot in tech. And Iâ€™m here to call bullshit. Because you donâ€™t build relationships fast and break them. You donâ€™t create trust by breaking things. You donâ€™t depend on things that break. You donâ€™t step on the ice of a pond with a pair of ice skates to figure out if itâ€™s strong enough to hold you. You figure it out before you trust it. You know if itâ€™s solid. And <em>thatâ€™s</em> what enables you to soar.</p>
