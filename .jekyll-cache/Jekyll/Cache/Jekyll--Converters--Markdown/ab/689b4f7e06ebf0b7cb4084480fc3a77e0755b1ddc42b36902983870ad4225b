I"®<p>A year ago today, I started my first job in DevRel. Before I started, I was chatting with the CEO of a consultancy, and one of the things he told me was to document publicly the work I was doing in DevRel to be transparent and have a clear record of the things I was working on. That advice has proven to be really useful over the last year, and it was one of the reasons I started the <a href="https://dev.to/bekahhw/series/19583">Technical Community Building Series</a> on Dev. Itâ€™s also helped me to think through the things Iâ€™ve learned over the last year, including the challenges Iâ€™ve faced, the successes and failures Iâ€™ve had, and my takeaways for the next year.</p>
