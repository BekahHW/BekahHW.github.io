I"/<p>July marked my fifth year in tech.That’s half a decade in a career I never imagined myself in. <a href="https://bekahhw.com/I-Came-into-Tech-via-Trauma">I came into tech via trauma</a>, so it’s always hard to answer the question about where I want to go next. But I’ve been getting that question a lot more lately. I think to understand where I want to go next (that post is coming soon), I need to reflect on where I’ve already been and what I’ve learned. With all of the time I’ve spent in tech, I’ve accumulated a toolbox of lessons – some through hard conversations, others through pushing myself beyond what I thought I was capable – that I know are useful to more than just me. Every year has added a new layer, a new ring in a tree, a new depth that shaped my understanding of tech.</p>
