I"·<p>Iâ€™ve been doing something new with my coding. Iâ€™ve been doing two-hour code sprintsâ€“which seems more like a 5k, but whatever sprint is easier to sayâ€“where I eliminate distractions and just code. So no social media, email, meetings, slack, etc. I post on Twitter what Iâ€™m going to do to see if anyone wants to join in with me, turn on some classical music and dive in. Itâ€™s been really great, and I find that Iâ€™m way more productive in large chunks of time, rather than 25-minute sessions. You should join me sometime! But hereâ€™s the thing, this week, I couldnâ€™t get my code working. Most of those two-hour sessions were spent breaking things or fixing one thing that broke another. It was frustrating, but Iâ€™m working on being ok with it. I know, I know, all you experienced devs are out there with your lecture voice telling me, â€œwelcome, to the dev world.â€ I get it, but itâ€™s going to take some getting used to, ok?</p>
