I"­<p>In early April of 2020, I held my first Virtual Coffee. I had recently lost my job because of COVID, and I felt alone and isolated. I didnâ€™t imagine that Iâ€™d still be doing Virtual Coffee today. I didnâ€™t imagine that Iâ€™d make some of the closest friends that Iâ€™d ever had. I didnâ€™t imagine that Iâ€™d experience the greatest losses of my entire life with them. Nothing in life could have prepared me for this.</p>
