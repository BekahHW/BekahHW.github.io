I"<p>Well, my “This Week in DevRel” series has turned into this “couple of months” in DevRel. In the words of Ferris Bueller, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” And I feel like a lot of the last two months, I’ve been moving fast and not taking the time to look around. I’m working on it. This post is more of a highlight reel; I plan on writing a reflection on how I plan on building time into looking around more than once in a while later in the month.</p>
