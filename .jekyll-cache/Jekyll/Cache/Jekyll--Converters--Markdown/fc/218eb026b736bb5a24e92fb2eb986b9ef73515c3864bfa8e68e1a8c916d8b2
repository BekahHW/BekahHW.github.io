I"	<p>I hit the point in my Flatiron School curriculum where I had to step away from tutorials and do a project on my own. Nervous didn’t even begin to describe what I was feeling. On top of that, I had two weeks to complete it and my husband was going to be out of town for five of those days. So I was momming my four kids and working on this project. Now, I have faced some difficult tasks in my life, and every time I approach them I think about how they won’t get done. And every single time I do them. And guess what, I get them done early. This time was no different, but I’m going to pull that confidence with me as I move forward. I get stuff done. I do it right. And I exceed my own expectations. And for this project, there were ten things that got me there.</p>
