I"¬<p>Every great hero needs the right weapon. Captain America has his shield, Aragorn wields AndÃºril, and David brought down Goliath with nothing but a slingshot and unshakeable faith.</p>

<p>As developers, facing the giants of legacy code, impossible challenges, and the eternal question, â€œCan you just add one small feature?â€, having the right â€œweaponâ€ can mean the difference in how successful we are. The AI coding assistant landscape is about finding your legendary weapon. Itâ€™s about choosing our superhero origin story.</p>
