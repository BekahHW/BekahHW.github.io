I";<p>A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD. One of the things I’ve learned after being diagnosed is that there is so much I don’t know and I’m learning everyday. Yesterday, someone shared <a href="https://twitter.com/tld1403/status/1288673819415191552?s=20">this tweet</a> in our Virtual Coffee slack and it helped me to break down the parts that I’m really struggling with right now. I’ve only told a couple of people, though it was both a surprise and not a surprise. And honestly, I was waiting to write this blogpost until after I “got a handle on it.” Spoiler alert: I don’t have a handle on it. Maybe I never will. But maybe this will help someone out. Maybe it will help you to know that being at home during quarantine with kids has intensified my symptoms in ways I couldn’t imagine. Maybe it would help you to know that I miss those hours I spent hyperfocusing on code maybe more than anything else during these times. Maybe it would help someone to know that some days things are ok, and then other days I learn something new about ADHD and it sends me down the rabbit hole of looking at my past interactions and feeling a new pain, a new wound because I can see that those times someone told me that I talked to loud or too fast or too much was a symptom of my ADHD. Maybe it will help someone.</p>
