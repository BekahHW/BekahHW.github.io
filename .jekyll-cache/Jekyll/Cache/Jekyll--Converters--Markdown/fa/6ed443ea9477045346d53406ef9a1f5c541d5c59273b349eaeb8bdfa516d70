I"®<p>Iâ€™m building my way up to a personal project. But before I approach the project, I want to reinforce basic knowledge by going over what Iâ€™ve learned about Ruby and SQL so I can do what I want. For me, the basics start with the different types of variables used in Ruby. Although Iâ€™m primarily using local variables, it doesnâ€™t make sense to move forward without knowing what other types of variables are out there.</p>
