I"¢<p>Itâ€™s okay to ask me how I â€œdo it.â€ Itâ€™s ok for you to ask me how I balance motherhood and work. Not every mom is ok with that, and I get why. But the reality is that many moms, probably most, bear the <a href="https://www.mother.ly/life/the-mental-load-falls-squarely-on-mothers-shouldersand-its-making-us-very-tired">mental load of the family</a>. And when I was learning to code, I found the conversations I had that were the most important to my journey were the ones about how moms were able to still mom and code, the ones about why we felt guilty when worked, about how we felt so exhausted at the end of the day. Itâ€™s ok to ask me how I â€œdo it.â€</p>
