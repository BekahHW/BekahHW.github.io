I"0<p>I get a lot of messages on social media asking me about coding, what it is, how to get started, whether or not to do a bootcamp, and where to get started. The truth is we are all the hero in our individual journeys. What worked for Frodo wouldn’t work for Veronica Mars, and what worked for her wouldn’t work for someone else. But there are parts of each of our journeys that will overlap. And in the moments that they overlap, I can give you some insight.</p>

<p>The top questions I get are where to start and what language to learn. I imagine most of the people asking these questions are thinking of making a career change. Their regular world isn’t stimulating/lucrative/exciting enough anymore. Tech looks fresh, fun, and interesting. So let’s start there.</p>

<h2 id="where-should-i-start">Where should I start?</h2>
<p>I always recommend that people start with free resources, because there are so many great ones out there. (FreeCodeCamp)[freecodecamp.com] is a great way to test out your interest in frontend development. So, the next question I get is “what is frontend development?” followed by “what is backend dev?”. Luckily, I have a good resource from <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/front-end-development-vs-back-end-development-where-to-start">Course Report that can break down the difference</a>. FreeCodeCamp got me started, but <a href="flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> kept me there. They have both a Coding Bootcamp prep and a Data Science bootcamp prep for FREEEEEE! (FYI, my posts are not sponsored, but I love to share what I love, so check them out.) The Flatiron School Coding Bootcamp also includes Ruby, so you’ll get some experience with a backend language.</p>

<h2 id="what-language-should-i-learn">What language should I learn?</h2>
<p>This is something I still struggle with. I love Ruby and JavaScript, but Python looks so appealing. I think one of the best ways to figure it out is to talk to someone in the industry who has been working. As a new coder, I never feel qualified to answer this question. I think it takes experience and a certain personality type to help you understand what you’re getting yourself into and whether or not you’ll like it. I love when people post their Myers-Briggs personality types on their social media info sections for this exact reason. If you don’t know your type, I highly recommend taking <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">the free test</a> at the very least. Find some product that you think are amazing and figure out what language they are working with. I think if you’re passionate about the product, that can go a long way to influence your decision.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do-once-i-learn-to-code">What can I do once I learn to code?</h2>
<p>Build something. Get a job. Start-up. Freelance. So much of what we do everyday is interact with screens, and those have been programmed by someone who’s learned how to code. You can make an impact in so many different fields, and you can also make a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-pay-for-a-bootcamp-or-college-degree">Should I pay for a bootcamp or college degree?</h2>
<p>This is such a personal question. First things first, if you decide you want to commit to coding, take a look at some of your dream jobs. What are the qualifications? If they want a CS degree you might need to go in that direction. I can wholeheartedly recommend Flatiron School’s Online Software Engineering bootcamp for sure. However, I have to mention that financial stability is always a critical factor in this decision making process. Yes, there are a lot of jobs out there, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get the first one you apply to.</p>

<h2 id="so-ive-made-the-decision-and-entered-a-coding-program-now-what">So I’ve made the decision and entered a coding program, now what?</h2>
<p>Find community. Things get hard, and they get hard fast. Finding support is essential. You can hear other people’s stories, find someone to pair program with, and have the cheerleaders who keep you going. <a href="momscancode.com">Moms Can: Code</a> was the first organization that made me feel like I was doing something important. I love the built-in community Flatiron School has established. And <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/">Code Newbie</a> has some incredible podcasts and twitter chats that have continually helped me to understand my process. One important thing to look at when you’re finding your people is who established the community. The founders or co-founders of each of these organizations are amazing and supportive people so it’s natural that the communities they shape are as well.</p>

<p>Your journey won’t look the same as mine. Don’t compare yourself to others. Ever. Think about what your goals are and go from there. But if you ever have any questions, feel free to reach out.</p>
