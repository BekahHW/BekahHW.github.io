I"†<p>Ok, if that title doesnâ€™t automatically make the <a href="Part-Time Model - Flight Of The Conchords (Lyrics) - YouTube">Flight of the Concords Part-Time Model</a> play in your head, you should go listen to it right now. Itâ€™s been one very interesting first week of being a dev, and I had planned on writing about how I got the job while I was on vacation, but we were hit with the worst stomach bug of all time, and it took us two days and a puke bucket in the car to get home. Worst. Vacation. Ever. Coming home wasnâ€™t that great either, because the closing on the old house got pushed back a week, our hot water heater died (and weâ€™re still taking cold showers a week later), and our AC went out during the hottest time of the summer.  This week has definitely gotten better, and a lot of that has to do with my new job! Let me do some back-tracking to talk about my job search first.</p>
