I"ê<p><em>Finding the assistant that fits just right.</em></p>

<p>At <a href="http://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a> over the last year, we‚Äôve been talking about our experiences with different AI Coding Assistants.  Some of the things I‚Äôve heard include, ‚ÄúIt felt like I was constantly being interrupted,‚Äù ‚ÄúI barely notice it‚Äôs there until I need it,‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes it feels like it‚Äôs micromanaging me, so I turn it off.‚Äù A lot of times, it‚Äôs the same tool with different experiences.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.to/bekahhw/series/32242">Over the last couple of weeks, I‚Äôve been writing about my journey to find the <em>right</em> coding assistant</a>, but I thought it would be useful to distill what I‚Äôve learned so far into a simple guide.</p>

<p>This is what I‚Äôm calling this ‚ÄúThe Goldilocks Problem.‚Äù Some AI coding assistants are too intrusive, some are too passive, and some are just right. But that sweet spot depends entirely on you.</p>

<p>This guide is designed to help you find an AI assistant that enhances your workflow without hijacking it.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-understand-the-types-of-ai-assistant-behavior">Step 1: Understand the Types of AI Assistant Behavior</h2>

<p>AI tools fall along a spectrum based on how actively they interact with you:</p>

<h3 id="1-the-background-helper-minimal-intrusion">1. The Background Helper (Minimal Intrusion)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Quiet until called upon</li>
  <li>Great for deep-focus devs</li>
  <li>Acts like autocomplete on demand</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-the-proactive-partner-moderate-intrusion">2. The Proactive Partner (Moderate Intrusion)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Offers smart suggestions as you type</li>

</ul>

Does the AI help you pick up where you left off, or get in the way?</li>

Can you stay in flow, or does it interrupt too much?</li>

Does it keep up when jumping between files and tasks?</li>
  <li>The Learning Moment Test
When you hit something unfamiliar, does it help you understand?</li>
  <li>The Cleanup Test
Can you read and modify the AI‚Äôs code later?</li>
</ol>
