I"¬<p>If you read my last post, you know Iâ€™ve made it a little further in my coderâ€™s quest. This post, Iâ€™m switching it up a bit from Joseph Campbell to Chris Vogler, whoâ€™s 2007 take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">Heroâ€™s Journey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Writer%27s_Journey:_Mythic_Structure_for_Writers">The Writerâ€™s Journey</a>, inspired nearly all of my writing. When we last met our hero, she had just composed her first bit of code and couldnâ€™t turn back. She. Was. Hooked. But now in the heart of the challenge of coding, where would she go? How would she do? This is the second act of our heroâ€™s journey.</p>
