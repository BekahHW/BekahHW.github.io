I"ó<p>Culture is hard to define. And we all like a different type of culture. We grow, learn, communicate in different ways; thereâ€™s not one culture that benefits everyone. Having diverse cultures is a beautiful part of the industry because thereâ€™s a space for all of us. It might be hard to find sometimes; we might need to dig. But thereâ€™s the hope that we find the space that welcomes us, as ourselves. But how do we find that? Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve thought about a lot recently. And something Iâ€™ve failed at in my career. Iâ€™m a trusting person. I was once in a behavioral interview where the hiring manager told me that it was both a strength and weakness that I was willing to have my heart broken. Iâ€™m not interested in toughening up. I donâ€™t particularly like my heart breaking, but Iâ€™d rather put myself into a situation where my heart is in it, than one where I donâ€™t care; and company culture plays an important role in the interview process, my success, and the questions I ask.</p>
