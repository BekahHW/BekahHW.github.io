I"Õ<p>I donâ€™t have a traditional path into tech. I came into tech because my organs ruptured when I had my fourth kid. I came into tech because I had PTSD. I came into tech because I have <a href="https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2020/08/03/ADHD,-the-Quarantine,-and-Me">ADHD</a>. I came into tech because after I had surgery to remove one organ and restructure another, I overdosed on morphine and then spent the next six days teaching from a hospital bed because I didnâ€™t have any rights as an adjunct instructor. I came into tech because I just wanted it to stop. I wanted my brain to stop. When I coded, it stopped.</p>

<p>My journey into tech isnâ€™t typical. And depending on how honest I am, my story is shocking. I didnâ€™t mean to make a career change. I just wanted to have something, to feel like I could succeed at anything at all. I came into tech because the last six years of being an adjunct instructor I fought to have rights, to get a pay increase, to create a community. And I left with nothing. I came into tech because I found support, a community that I was seeking for years.</p>

<p>Four days after having my fourth kid, I went into my OBGYNs office. It haunts me. I told her about the horrific symptoms I was experiencing, and she told me â€œitâ€™s not my problem.â€ Iâ€™ve told this story a thousand times, and it still hurts to say it. And it hurts because she said it to me, but it hurts because Iâ€™m not the only one who has felt abandoned in the room.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not the only one who has felt like there was no hope. Iâ€™m not the only one whoâ€™s felt like no one could ever understand. Iâ€™m not the only one who has been left alone in the corner to watch every other person go on living their life while I died a little bit more inside everyday.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s everybodyâ€™s problem.</p>

<p>There is not a moment in time that I donâ€™t carry that with me. I carry it with me because I very much do not ever want any other person to feel that way. I carry it with me, because it drives a force inside of me to do what I can to change the systems that make people feel like they are nothing, like they are not worthy, like no one should help them. When I left that room that day, I thought that I was not worth anyoneâ€™s time. I wasnâ€™t a person; I was a problem.</p>

<p>I have always been a passionate person. I have always been intense. It has both been a characteristic that drives me and one that has isolated me from people. Sometimes Iâ€™m too much for people. I am more than they can handle. But I canâ€™t help being fully myself. I canâ€™t help that I canâ€™t stop myself when I see new paths for change or growth or whatever that are driven by this intense desire to make sure that no one feels alone.</p>

<p>I started a <a href="https://beautyinthescar.com/">blog</a> to talk about my trauma and this is a crossover post. I learned to code because it stopped the trauma from repeating over and over in my head while I sat in front of the computer. I kept coding because I had community. I got excited about coding because I realized that code couldâ€™ve prevented what happened to me. But thatâ€™s womenâ€™s health, and not enough people care about womenâ€™s health.</p>

<p>If no one will do the thing that needs to be done, I will. But I also know that when we work in isolation, we will never be as effective as we can be with a community. Because with a community there is support. With a community there is meaning and purpose and growth.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I was at JSConf Hawaii, and I told a woman that although my trauma was the worst thing that ever happened to me, I wouldnâ€™t take it back. Iâ€™m a better person. Without that trauma, I donâ€™t know the importance of community. WIthout that trauma, I donâ€™t get into tech. Without trauma <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a> is never started. Without trauma I donâ€™t understand the importance of vulnerability, of meeting people where they are at, of letting people <em>know</em> me; I guard and protect myself. I donâ€™t become the developer that I can be. I donâ€™t find a way to push through those times when people tell me that I canâ€™t do both; that I canâ€™t create community and be a developer.</p>

<p>This post is very much about how I became a developer, but itâ€™s very much more about how I became <em>me</em>. And thatâ€™s the important part. Because I am a person first. And being human, recognizing the diverse experiences and challenges and talents and perspectives of the people around us matters.</p>
