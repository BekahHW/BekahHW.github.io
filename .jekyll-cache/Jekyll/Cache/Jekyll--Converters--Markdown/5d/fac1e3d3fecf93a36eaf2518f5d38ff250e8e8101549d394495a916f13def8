<p>Iâ€™ve heard people say they interview for practice or for fun. I am not one of those people. I am the opposite of those people. On top of being not one of those people, I am also a person who is incredibly satisfied with my job and life, except as an independent contractor my family and I pay out of pocket for medical insurance. And I have over $70,000 of medical bills sitting on my desk with more coming. So when someone from a notable company in tech reached out to me and encouraged me to apply to a DevRel position, and then when I talked to a friend in tech who encouraged me to apply for a senior DevRel position, I did. This is the first in a series of posts on what Iâ€™ve learned through this process.</p>

<p>As an early-career developer who gets maybe more DMs than most early-career devs because of what Iâ€™ve done with <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a>, Iâ€™ve had a number of people reach out and ask me to apply for jobs. Usually, I decline and recommend someone else I know. If you look at the job, and itâ€™s not something thatâ€™s interesting, within your desired salary, or you find out more about the team and you donâ€™t think youâ€™d be a good fit, itâ€™s ok to pass or to recommend someone else you think would be a good fit.</p>

<h2 id="do-your-research-and-reach-out-to-people-you-trust">Do Your Research and Reach out to People you Trust</h2>

<p>Since coming into tech, Iâ€™ve always said that my dream job is working with good people. And thatâ€™s 100% true for me. I have been working with goodâ€“actually amazingâ€“people. Iâ€™ve also seen so many devs fall into really toxic work environments. So if Iâ€™m going to leave a situation Iâ€™m happy with, Iâ€™m going to do my research. For me this means learning about the people on the teams, the companies, and DMing people who I know in tech and asking them about the teams, companies, and/or positions. Through these DMs, I learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some tough questions to ask to gauge the strength of the teams and to avoid workplace toxicity;</li>
  <li>How to gauge the sincerity of responses;</li>
  <li>How current teams functioned within the organization and how that would impact the position;</li>
  <li>What the current team dynamics are;</li>
  <li>About the projects, processes, and structures the teams use.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ask-direct-questions">Ask Direct Questions</h2>

<p>Because I wasnâ€™t actively looking for work, I came to the process with a privileged position. I could afford to ask questions that some might be afraid to ask initially. Some of the questions I asked prior to the interviews were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the salary range?</li>
  <li>Could I continue organizing Virtual Coffee as part of the job?</li>
  <li>What are your current pain points?</li>
  <li>Is the schedule flexible?</li>
  <li>What does the health insurance like?</li>
  <li>Can we talk about the title?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, <em>youâ€™re</em> interviewing them as well. If you have values or standards that are important to you, itâ€™s ok to be selective from the very beginning. In fact, it was the openness and honesty of the answers that made me feel comfortable going further in the process, which Iâ€™ll talk about in my next post, because these werenâ€™t quick and simple processes.</p>
