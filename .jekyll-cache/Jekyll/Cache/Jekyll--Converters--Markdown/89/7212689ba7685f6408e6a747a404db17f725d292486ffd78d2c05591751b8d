I"<p>My plan has always been to interview for jobs <em>after</em> I finished Flatiron School. But when the perfect job comes along, you have to apply for it. It was PT, remote, paid well, and was working for an organization that had a mission I believed it. It checked every box on my list. So I fixed up my resume, wrote a cover letter conveying why this would be the perfect place for me to be, and got a start-up founder to write me an unsolicited letter of recommendation for this position. Thatâ€™s how badly I wanted this job.</p>
