I"–<p>Iâ€™ve stuck with the same project idea for the last three projects for a couple of reasons: I have a hard time coming up with ideas, Iâ€™m passionate about this idea, I wanted to clearly compare the processes of coding in different languages and that seemed easiest by carrying the idea across Ruby and into JS. Here I am again developing Women of Trauma with a Rails backend and a React frontend.</p>
