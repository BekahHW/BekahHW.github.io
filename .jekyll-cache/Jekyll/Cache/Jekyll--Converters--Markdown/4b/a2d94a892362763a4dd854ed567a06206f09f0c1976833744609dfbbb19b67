I"È<p>I <em>like</em> my comfort zone. A lot. Itâ€™s a familiar space. Itâ€™s a warm blanket, a cup of coffee, in front of a fire. Itâ€™s the crack of the bat against a baseball on a hot July day. Itâ€™s hearing that song from when I was eleven and still knowing all the words. I think comfort zones are good, but pushing ourselves out of them, pushing ourselves into unknown territories, those are the places we grow.</p>

<p>The last twelve months have been a lot of growing, and I didnâ€™t even have to push myself to do it. The world did it for me. But there are times when I felt like I had been comfortable for too long, and I needed to push myself to do those things that scared me.</p>

<p>Sometimes that thing was asking for help instead of going deeper down the rabbit hole by myself. Sometimes it was accepting someoneâ€™s offer to help. Sometimes it was jumping into a new adventure without all the planning and discussions I would have done if I wanted to make sure the moment was just right. Taking my first dev job, almost two years ago, was pushing myself way out of my comfort zone. Sometimes itâ€™s sharing these moments with others. Some of these things I talk about on this <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/0109-bekah-dan/">Virtual Coffee podcast episode</a>, which itself is one of the things that I did to force myself out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>I recently decided I was going to livestream talking through and working on my postpartum wellness app, which was absolutely terrifying. But I was inspired by Drew Clements talking about how he livestreams working on <a href="https://protege.dev/">Protege.dev</a> as an accountability tool. Itâ€™s not enough that Iâ€™m still very much new to React Native. I wanted to add to that the accountability that comes with livestreaming.Iâ€™ve only done it a couple of times, but I learned that itâ€™s not about having all of the answers; itâ€™s about communicating when you donâ€™t.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s ok to have questions. Itâ€™s ok to look things up. Itâ€™s ok to forget how to do something youâ€™ve done 100x before. It happens.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s about not getting frustrated when you donâ€™t have those things. Itâ€™s about learning how to move forward, how to grow. And itâ€™s remembering that process the next time you have that feeling of not being good enough.</p>

<p>There are so many times that Iâ€™m mad at myself for not knowing more or for feeling like I should be better at coding than I am. That I should have more done than I do. And thatâ€™s not productive; negative self talk does not help me grow. (Iâ€™m going to say it again, for the people who need to hear it; also, me. I need to hear it again.) Negative self talk does not help me grow.</p>

<p>Getting out of your comfort zone and growing is hard. And sometimes it means hearing things that are hard to hear. Sometimes, itâ€™s having those hard conversations when you want to ignore the problem and hope it disappears.</p>

<p>A friend said to me the other day, â€œBekah, thereâ€™s a reason theyâ€™re called growing pains. It doesnâ€™t feel good.â€ I think itâ€™s about embracing that pain by getting out of your comfort zone, but not being <em>stuck</em> in the place you were last time, last week, last tutorial.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t solve problems by ignoring them. You tackle the error in your console one piece at a time. And sometimes itâ€™s minutes and sometimes itâ€™s days, but damn it feels good when you finally have that project up on the screen. And thatâ€™s worth it.</p>
