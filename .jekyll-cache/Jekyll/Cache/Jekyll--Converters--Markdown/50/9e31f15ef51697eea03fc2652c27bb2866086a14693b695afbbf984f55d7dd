I"¡<p>Iâ€™ve been a developer for two and a half years. And for that entire time Iâ€™ve worked as a freelancer and consultant. Iâ€™ve loved that work. One of my biggest pieces of advice to new developers has been to find a good and supportive person/team to work with. Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have that almost the entire time. So Iâ€™ve worked with great people, Iâ€™ve enjoyed what I was doing and learned a ton along the way, and really had no aspirations to leave. So why am I leaving that all behind and taking on a new role, in a part of the tech industry Iâ€™ve never worked in, and joining my first DevRel team at Deepgram as their Technical Community Builder?</p>
