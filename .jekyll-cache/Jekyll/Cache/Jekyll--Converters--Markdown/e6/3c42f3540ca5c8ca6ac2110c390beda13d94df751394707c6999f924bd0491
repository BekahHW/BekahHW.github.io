I"<p>So we’ve been using the word tensor, just throwing it around, but now we’re going to learn a little more about it. You don’t <em>have</em> to understand everything. This isn’t an in depth exploration of what tensors are or a debate about whether the mathematical definition of tensors versus the computer science definition of tensors. Understanding enough to know <em>how</em> you can use tensors should be the goal here, so a basic understanding can allow us to do a better job of using tensors in our development.</p>
