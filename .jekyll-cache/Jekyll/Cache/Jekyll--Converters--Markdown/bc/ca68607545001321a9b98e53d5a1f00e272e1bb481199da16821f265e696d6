I"¶<p>Weâ€™ve all been there: a meeting that shouldâ€™ve been an email or a slack message or really nothing at all. There are few things that frustrate me more than wasted time. Iâ€™ve said this before, moms are great employees because we donâ€™t have any time to waste. Not every second of the day has to be â€œproductiveâ€ but when you have an activity that has a primary purpose of being productive, you better make sure that it is.</p>
