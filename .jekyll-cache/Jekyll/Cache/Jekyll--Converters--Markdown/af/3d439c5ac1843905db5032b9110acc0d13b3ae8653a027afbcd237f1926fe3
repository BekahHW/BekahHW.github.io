I"p<p>I have a love-hate relationship with my trauma. I hate it because of how it stopped my life for so long, how it prevented me from being myself, how it made me feel like I was stuck in this bubble of time while everyone else moved forward without me. I love it because had I not been through trauma, I wouldn’t have discovered my love for coding. I love it because it’s given me a purpose to share my story to and to help other people find healing through sharing theirs. So what better way to merge the two than my Rails project. Two things stood out in the treatment of trauma: telling your story and writing it down gives you control over the experience and can create catharsis and finding out you’re not alone. Fun fact: The writing portion of this was inspired by <a href="https://pen.org/prison-writing/]">PEN America’s Prison and Justice Writing Program</a>. The second thing I wanted to incorporate was community: those who have experienced trauma often feel alone and isolated. Allowing for users to see other people’s stories can help them to realize they are not alone. So how did I approach this with code?</p>
