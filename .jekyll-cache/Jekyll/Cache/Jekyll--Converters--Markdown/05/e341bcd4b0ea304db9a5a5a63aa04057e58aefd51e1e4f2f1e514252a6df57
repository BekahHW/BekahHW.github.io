I"À<p>Iâ€™ve been dating around for a while now, and Iâ€™ve found some good partners and some bad partners. But whatâ€™s important to me? Well, Iâ€™m interested in know the what, how, and why questions. What are you and what is your function in this world? Why are you important? How do you accomplish all the wonderful things you do? If I can answer these three questions, weâ€™re closer to becoming soulmates. But have I found that special one?</p>
