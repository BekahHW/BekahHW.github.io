I"›<p>I have a very disorganized 148 page google doc of notes Iâ€™ve taken from all the online resources Iâ€™ve used for HTML, CSS, JS, and ethereum. They donâ€™t look pretty. In fact, theyâ€™re messier than my living room. One day Iâ€™ll get around to organizing and cleaning them up, but that might be when I donâ€™t need them any more. For now the Command F key, keeps everything where it needs to be. But just because my coding notes are a mess, doesnâ€™t mean my code should be a mess. In fact, I wish I wouldâ€™ve taken the time to get my code ready to date as I was doing tutorials. Hereâ€™s what that means:</p>

<p>My code is sometimes disastrous. Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m doing, Iâ€™m just sorting through that 148 page document until I find some explanation that I think applies to what Iâ€™m trying to do. But leaving my code a mess isnâ€™t doing me any favors. In fact, it inhibits my growth as a coder. A couple of months ago, I was working on the  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api">Freecodecamp Twitch API</a>. It went beyond my abilities, so I gave up. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago when I tried to go back to my codepen to figure it out. (Please do not look at my codepen, Iâ€™m begging you.) I couldnâ€™t even understand what I was trying to do. Imagine if I needed to ask a developer for help or if I were working on a project that I had to hand off. Dirty code isnâ€™t going to make you friends.</p>

<p>Another good coding practice is to comment out your code. For newbs who want to know more about commenting out code, this is a <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/code-comments-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-be9cc65fbf83">good resource</a>. Even with my dirty code, I would have had some idea of what I was trying to do if there were comments. I would love to go back through projects Iâ€™ve worked on and see what I was thinking. Not only does this help with communication among developers, but for newbie coders like me, it can help us to track our progress.</p>

<h2 id="put-some-lipstick-on-it">Put some lipstick on it</h2>
<p>You should always polish your work. That means taking some time to go back and clean it up, test it out, and even proofread the copy. Last week, I posted a blog that I was really excited about. In the preview mode, everything looked good. Apparently, that was not the case, and I had screwed up the link formattingâ€“still not sure how I overlooked that. I thought I had my lipstick on properly, but really I was wearing it on my teeth. Your code should be readable, in good form, and produce the desired results on the screen.</p>

<p>I know that my code still is messy, but building habits starts early. One of my goals is to work on open source projects. To do that right, I have to be able to work with other developers and to collaborate in ways that other people can understand. Because this isnâ€™t an objective, teachable task, itâ€™s only mentioned in most of the online resources Iâ€™ve used. But for my fellow newbie coders out there, letâ€™s work on doing this together.</p>
