I"1<p>I’ve been interested in Machine Learning since I was learning to code. I didn’t know how I would get there, but I <em>knew</em> there was potential to solve the problems that I wanted to solve. It looked complicated, but I wanted to know more. I wanted to see how I could share in this part of the tech industry. I wanted to have a voice. And then I met <a href="https://twitter.com/GantLaborde">Gant Laborde</a>, and he opened up the world and wrote a book on it. So of course, I thought it would be a great idea to get out of my comfort zone and learn TensorFlow.js (TFJS) using <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-tensorflowjs/9781492090786/">Gant’s Learning TensorFlow.js</a>, and I would take it up a notch, and embrace uncomfortable learning in public by livestreaming as I did.</p>
