I"î6<p>Every team has one, and, tbh, a lot of relationships have one. The person who remembers. For teams, it might be the person who remembers to update the changelog. Who posts the weekly standup summary. Who follows up on that GitHub issue from three weeks ago. Who makes sure the docs match the latest release. Who bridges the gap between what engineering ships and what the rest of the company knows about.</p>

<p>We call this ‚Äúglue work,‚Äù and research shows it disproportionately falls on women in teams, and mothers in relationships. It‚Äôs the invisible labor that keeps everything running smoothly, but rarely shows up in performance reviews or promotion discussions.</p>

<p>The problem is that glue work is essential, but it shouldn‚Äôt be someone‚Äôs primary job. And it definitely shouldn‚Äôt be the reason talented people get passed over for advancement.</p>

<p>But what if AI workflows could be the glue instead?</p>

<h2 id="the-glue-work-problem">The Glue Work Problem</h2>

<p>Tanya Reilly‚Äôs essay <a href="https://www.noidea.dog/glue/">‚ÄúBeing Glue‚Äù</a> describes how critical but undervalued work like coordinating between teams, translating technical concepts, maintaining documentation, ensuring follow-through often becomes invisible. The people who do it often make everything seem easy. But there‚Äôs a cost, and it‚Äôs compounding in the background.</p>

<p>If you have one teammate who‚Äôs spending hours each week:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updating tickets after standups</li>
  <li>Posting release summaries to Slack</li>
  <li>Making sure customer support knows about new features</li>
  <li>Chasing down PR reviews</li>
  <li>Updating documentation after merges</li>
  <li>Following up on blocked issues</li>
</ul>

<p>when none of this is their actual job, then they may be your ‚Äúglue.‚Äù All of it is necessary. But when they stop doing it, things fall apart.</p>

<p>Maybe it doesn‚Äôt seem that bad right now, but coordination work compounds as teams grow.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-workflows-could-be-the-glue">What If Workflows Could Be the Glue?</h2>

<p>This is where composed AI workflows change everything. Not because they eliminate coordination work, but because they automate it at the seams between tasks.</p>

<p>In his post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/individual-workflows-scale-linearly-composed-compound-chad-metcalf-x7fyc">composed workflows</a>, Continue CEO Chad Metcalf makes an important distinction: a single workflow saves time, but composed workflows compound. When the output of one workflow can trigger the next, you‚Äôre doing more than just automating individual tasks. You‚Äôre automating the entire coordination system.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at what this actually means.</p>

<h3 id="example-1-the-release-communication-burden">Example 1: The Release Communication Burden</h3>

<p><strong>Current state:</strong> After every release, someone (usually the same someone) needs to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draft changelog entries</li>
  <li>Update product documentation</li>
  <li>Post to company Slack</li>
  <li>Update customer-facing docs</li>
  <li>Create support team briefing</li>
  <li>Close related Linear issues</li>
</ol>

<p>That ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù spends 2-3 hours per release on coordination work. Not working on more impactful work. Just making sure everyone knows what shipped.</p>

<p><strong>With composed workflows:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Merge to main 
  ‚Üí Extract changes from PR descriptions 
  ‚Üí Draft changelog entry 
  ‚Üí Update technical docs 
  ‚Üí Generate customer-facing summary 
  ‚Üí Post to internal Slack 
  ‚Üí Update support knowledge base 
  ‚Üí Close related issues
  ‚Üí Post completion summary
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The entire coordination chain runs automatically. The output of one workflow triggers the next. No one spends their afternoon being glue. Instead, they become the human in the loop who reviews and improves the process.</p>

<h3 id="example-2-the-follow-up-tax">Example 2: The Follow-Up Tax</h3>

<p><strong>Current state:</strong> You‚Äôre in standup. Someone mentions they‚Äôre blocked on a security review. Everyone nods. The meeting ends.</p>

<p>Three days later, nothing‚Äôs happened because nobody remembered to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a ticket</li>
  <li>Tag the security team</li>
  <li>Follow up when there‚Äôs no response</li>
  <li>Update the original ticket</li>
  <li>Let the blocked person know it‚Äôs unblocked</li>
</ul>

<p>Guess who remembers? The glue person, who now spends their time tracking other people‚Äôs blockers instead of writing code.</p>

<p><strong>With composed workflows:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Blocked on X" detected in standup notes 
  ‚Üí Create Linear issue with context 
  ‚Üí Tag relevant team 
  ‚Üí Set reminder for 2 days 
  ‚Üí Follow up if no response 
  ‚Üí Update original ticket when resolved 
  ‚Üí Notify blocked person
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The follow-through happens automatically. Nobody has to be the memory keeper.</p>

<h3 id="example-3-the-support-handoff">Example 3: The Support Handoff</h3>

<p><strong>Current state:</strong> Customer reports a bug in Slack. Engineering fixes it. But somehow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support never gets notified the fix is live</li>
  <li>Customer still thinks it‚Äôs broken</li>
  <li>Docs don‚Äôt reflect the fix</li>
  <li>The original Slack thread is forgotten</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone (the glue person) ends up manually connecting all these dots. Every. Single. Time.</p>

<p><strong>With composed workflows:</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bug report in Slack 
  ‚Üí Create Linear issue 
  ‚Üí PR created and merged 
  ‚Üí Update documentation 
  ‚Üí Generate fix summary 
  ‚Üí Post to support channel 
  ‚Üí Reply to original Slack thread 
  ‚Üí Close Linear issue with summary
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The entire loop closes itself. From report to fix to notification to documentation to closure. No human glue required.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-works-where-other-solutions-dont">Why This Works Where Other Solutions Don‚Äôt</h2>

<h3 id="its-not-about-replacing-people">It‚Äôs Not About Replacing People</h3>

<p>AI workflows aren‚Äôt replacing the glue person‚Äôs judgment or expertise. They‚Äôre replacing the repetitive coordination tasks that shouldn‚Äôt require judgment.</p>

<p>When a PR merges, updating the changelog doesn‚Äôt need human insight. Following up on a blocked issue after two days doesn‚Äôt require strategic thinking. Posting a deployment summary to Slack isn‚Äôt creative work.</p>

<p>These are mechanical transitions between tasks. Perfect candidates for automation.</p>

<h3 id="it-compounds-over-time">It Compounds Over Time</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs what makes this different from other automation attempts: composition creates compounding value.</p>

<p>Each workflow you add doesn‚Äôt just save time on that specific task. It amplifies the value of workflows already running. The deployment workflow outputs information the changelog workflow needs. The Linear sync workflow triggers the documentation update workflow. The customer support workflow feeds the product insights workflow.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre not just automating individual tasks. You‚Äôre automating the entire coordination system.</p>

<h3 id="it-preserves-the-actual-value-of-glue">It Preserves the Actual Value of ‚ÄúGlue‚Äù</h3>

<p>The valuable part of glue work isn‚Äôt the mechanical coordination. It‚Äôs the strategic connection-making, the pattern recognition, the ability to see across teams and translate context.</p>

<p>When AI workflows handle the mechanical parts, the humans who were doing glue work can focus on the strategic parts.</p>

<p>They can spend time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying patterns across customer feedback</li>
  <li>Improving team processes</li>
  <li>Mentoring junior developers</li>
  <li>Solving actually complex problems</li>
  <li>Advancing their technical skills</li>
</ul>

<p>The things that actually deserve their expertise.</p>

<h2 id="the-composition-advantage">The Composition Advantage</h2>

<p>Individual workflows are helpful. Composed workflows are transformative.</p>

<p>As Chad Metcalf writes in his post on composed workflows: ‚ÄúIndividual workflows give linear improvements. Composed workflows compound.‚Äù This distinction is crucial when thinking about how to replace organizational glue work.</p>

<p>Because here‚Äôs what happens when workflows compose: the coordination work stops being a burden on any individual. Instead, it becomes part of the system itself.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre not asking someone to remember to update the docs after deployment. The deployment workflow triggers the documentation workflow automatically. You‚Äôre not relying on someone to follow up on blocked issues. The standup workflow creates follow-up workflows with built-in reminders.</p>

<p>This is infrastructure that scales with your team. As you grow, the glue work compounds. But with composed workflows, the automation compounds instead.</p>

<h2 id="real-team-impact-beyond-time-savings">Real Team Impact: Beyond Time Savings</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about what this actually means for teams.</p>

<h3 id="no-more-that-person">No More ‚ÄúThat Person‚Äù</h3>

<p>When coordination work is automated, it stops being concentrated on one or two people. The person who used to spend 10 hours a week on glue work can spend those hours on actual engineering. Or product work. Or whatever they were actually hired to do.</p>

<p>More importantly: they stop being the bottleneck. When knowledge and coordination flows through automated systems rather than through specific people, teams become more resilient. People can take vacation without everything falling apart. New team members can onboard without needing to know who to ask for everything.</p>

<h3 id="career-equity">Career Equity</h3>

<p>Glue work is often invisible during performance reviews. ‚ÄúSarah keeps everything running smoothly‚Äù doesn‚Äôt translate to promotion decisions the way ‚Äúshipped three major features‚Äù does.</p>

<p>When AI workflows handle coordination, engineers can focus on work that‚Äôs more visible and valued. This has disproportionate impact on people‚Äîoften women and mothers‚Äîwho tend to take on more glue work.</p>

<h3 id="team-velocity-at-scale">Team Velocity at Scale</h3>

<p>Small teams can coordinate informally. ‚ÄúHey, remember to update the docs‚Äù works when you‚Äôre five people.</p>

<p>At 20 people? 50? Informal coordination breaks down. You need systems. The question is: will those systems be human-dependent, automated, or composed with a human in the loop?</p>

<p>Composed workflows scale. Human coordination doesn‚Äôt.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-actually-do-this">How to Actually Do This</h2>

<p>Don‚Äôt start by trying to automate everything. Start with the most repetitive, predictable coordination work on your team.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-identify-your-glue-work">Step 1: Identify Your Glue Work</h3>

<p>Have an honest conversation. Ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What coordination tasks happen after every release?</li>
  <li>What follow-ups consistently fall through the cracks?</li>
  <li>Where does information get stuck between teams?</li>
  <li>Who‚Äôs spending time on mechanical updates vs. strategic work?</li>
</ul>

<p>Write it down. You‚Äôre looking for patterns, not one-off tasks.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-build-one-workflow">Step 2: Build One Workflow</h3>

<p>Pick the most painful coordination task. The one that happens constantly and requires zero judgment.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changelog updates after merges</li>
  <li>Standup note distribution</li>
  <li>PR review reminders</li>
  <li>Linear ticket status syncing</li>
  <li>Documentation updates post-deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>Build a workflow that handles it end-to-end. Run it for a week. Measure intervention rate‚Äîhow often does it need human correction?</p>

<p>Get that intervention rate below 5%. Then move to step 3.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-compose">Step 3: Compose</h3>

<p>Look at the output of your first workflow. What happens next in the coordination chain?</p>

<p>If your workflow posts deployment notes to Slack, what normally happens after that? Maybe documentation gets updated. Maybe customer support gets briefed. Maybe Linear tickets get closed.</p>

<p>Build workflows for those next steps. Connect them to your first workflow‚Äôs output.</p>

<p>Now you have composition. One workflow‚Äôs completion triggers the next. The coordination chain runs automatically.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-keep-going">Step 4: Keep Going</h3>

<p>Each new workflow amplifies the ones before it. The deployment workflow feeds the documentation workflow. The documentation workflow triggers the changelog workflow. The changelog workflow posts to Slack, which triggers the customer communication workflow.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre not just saving time on individual tasks. You‚Äôre building a system where coordination happens automatically at every transition point.</p>

<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>This isn‚Äôt just about efficiency. It‚Äôs about equity.</p>

<p>When essential coordination work is visible and automated, nobody gets stuck being the invisible glue. Everyone can focus on the work they‚Äôre actually good at, the work that gets recognized and rewarded.</p>

<p>Teams that build composed AI workflows aren‚Äôt just shipping faster. They‚Äôre redistributing the coordination burden from people to systems. They‚Äôre making space for everyone to do their best work.</p>

<p>Look at your team. Who‚Äôs the glue person? What would they be working on if they weren‚Äôt constantly coordinating?</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the real value of composition.</p>
