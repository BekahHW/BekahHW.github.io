I"»<p>Well, my ‚ÄúThis Week in DevRel‚Äù series has turned into this ‚Äúcouple of months‚Äù in DevRel. In the words of Ferris Bueller, ‚ÄúLife moves pretty fast. If you don‚Äôt stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.‚Äù And I feel like a lot of the last two months, I‚Äôve been moving fast and not taking the time to look around. I‚Äôm working on it. This post is more of a highlight reel; I plan on writing a reflection on how I plan on building time into looking around more than once in a while later in the month.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<h3 id="conferences">Conferences</h3>
<p>I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to give my talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoo0B7GFvo8">Does your Org Need a Community</a> at <a href="https://www.magnoliajs.com/">MagnoliaJS</a> this year and to attend <a href="https://momentumdevcon.com/">Momentum Conf</a>.
I did a lot of learning at these conferences. Some of it was when I was listening to talks, including one on community and one on burnout. Some of it was talking to other people in the field. I gravitate towards people who are doing some type of community building, whether or not that‚Äôs in their job description. Having this conversations helps me to get a pulse on the wider tech community, bounce ideas off of community professionals, and explore new ideas and initiatives.</p>

<h3 id="hacktoberfest">Hacktoberfest</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs my favorite time of the year! This year I participated as a mentor, contributor, and maintainer. I got to work on my postpartum wellness app with others and launch a new Deepgram project as a maintainer that I really enjoyed working on. It‚Äôs a chrome extension that allows the user to get transcripts in a browser tab, and we‚Äôre working on functionality to have translation available as well. I plan on keeping this going as long as the ideas are flowing and folks find it helpful. If you want to check it out, here‚Äôs the <a href="https://github.com/deepgram-devs/dg-translation-chrome-ext">GitHub repo</a>. I also supported the <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a> Hacktoberfest Initiative. If you want to read more about that, check out <a href="https://dev.to/virtualcoffee/virtual-coffee-hacktoberfest-2022-roundup-1c2k">Dan Ott‚Äôs post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="livestreams">Livestreams</h3>
<p>I did THREE in October! I did some TypeScript on Virtual Coffee‚Äôs <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/virtualcoffeeio">TypeScript Tuesday Twitch Stream</a>. I was also a guest on Mia Moore‚Äôs stream where we talked about all things open source, and I also did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMQb5qN5ob8">Project Showcase stream with Appwrite</a>, where we walked through Deepgram open source projects and talked about some of the ways we try to make our repos contributor friendly.</p>

<h3 id="blogging">Blogging</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt been able to have the cadence I want with blogging, but I did get a couple of posts in, including this one on [Open Source Projects for Hacktoberfest]
(https://dev.to/deepgram/open-source-projects-for-hacktoberfest-2022-4cia), yesterday‚Äôs <a href="https://t.co/rkob8LcmsO">post on imposter syndrome</a>  and a new one on 5 Reasons to Contribute to Open Source Projects that will be up soon. The good news is, our monthly challenge for Virtual Coffee is <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/nov-2022">Let‚Äôs Write 100k words together!</a>, so you‚Äôll be reading a lot more from me this month.</p>

<h3 id="hackathon">Hackathon</h3>
<p>We ran a hackathon internally with the Learn Build Teach Community. We provided support, ran a couple of workshops, and are in the judging stages. This is the first time we ran an internal community hackathon, so this was a real learning experience. As part of the post-hackathon experience, we‚Äôre doing evaluation of what worked and what didn‚Äôt, and what our strategy will be going forward.</p>

<h3 id="twitter-spaces">Twitter Spaces</h3>
<p>I‚Äôm back on the Twitter Space game! I‚Äôm running them through the <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepgramAI">@DeepgramAI</a> Twitter account. I‚Äôve been doing them most Wednesdays at 1pm ET. So if you‚Äôre not following us, you might want to. Another option is to check out our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/categories/events">Events discussion</a> in our Community Forum where I‚Äôm posting our spaces at least a week in advance. If you have questions or comments before the space, feel free to drop them in there and we‚Äôll talk about it on the space.</p>

<p>I think this is a pretty good overview of the things that I work on as a technical community builder. Oh, and one last achievement I want to share. I received one of the Twilio spotlight awards. If you want to know more about it and me, you can check out <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/meet-the-inspirational-leaders-creating-a-better-future-for-developers?utm_campaign=devsearchlight2022_reveal&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=twiliodevs">the Business Insider article</a> Being a Technical Community Builder requires a lot of pivoting, versatility, and getting outside of my comfort zone. But if I wasn‚Äôt spending time getting out of my comfort zone, then it wouldn‚Äôt be that fun, would it?</p>
