I"W<p>Look, if you’re a parent, I don’t have to tell you that life is hard with kids. It’s hard when they’re a baby, it’s hard when they’re adolescents, it’s hard when they’re teenagers. It’s hard. But let’s add to that. Let’s add a career change and learning to code. You’re begging to be (even more) overwhelmed, to feel like you can’t do one more thing, to feel completely inadequate, but you’re not. What you are is a superhero, a person willing to take on a new challenge, to grow, to push yourself to your limit, to be a person you never knew you were capable of.</p>
