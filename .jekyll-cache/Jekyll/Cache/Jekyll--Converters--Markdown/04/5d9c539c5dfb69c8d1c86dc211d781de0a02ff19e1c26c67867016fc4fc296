I"²<p>This is not the post I wanted to write. This is a post about mental health. This is a post for anyone who struggles, who has felt the irrational grip of PTSD.</p>

<p>The three year anniversary of my trauma is October 5th. Thatâ€™s the day I gave birth to my fourth child, when my uterus ruptured into my bladder, when they told me I was fine and it was normal pain, when they told me I already had a Percoset, and they couldnâ€™t give me anything else. When, three days later, despite still having horrific symptoms, they told me I was fine and sent me home.</p>

<p>When I was in therapy, my counselor asked me, â€œBekah, when was the last time you felt safe?â€ This is the time of year I stop feeling safe. Itâ€™s not something I choose, itâ€™s body memory. There are so many good things in my life right now, but I canâ€™t enjoy them like I usually do, because, around this time of year, thereâ€™s a constant blanket of anxiety that wraps itself around my body.</p>

<p>I had two panic attacks this month. I havenâ€™t had any since last year at this time. I buy food to make from the grocery store, but I donâ€™t want to make it. Itâ€™s strange, really. If someone puts food in front of me, Iâ€™ll eat it, but the act of making food somehow seems really difficult and overwhelming. I have spurts of being my normal self and then I try doubly hard to complete the tasks I havenâ€™t when the blanket wraps around my arms.</p>

<p>I know there are people that say itâ€™s time for me to get over it. I heard people say that weeks after I had my surgery, the surgery that lead to me overdosing on morphine in the hospital because my pump wasnâ€™t properly capped, that lead to taking Narcan, the surgery that put me in the hospital for a week, where I had to learn to change my own catheter bag that Iâ€™d have to take care of for the next month. The week where I didnâ€™t see my newborn baby or my kids because I had a six-inch incision up my abdomen.</p>

<p>I want to get over it too. I want to be able to sleep at night. I want to be the person I am the other 11 months of the year. I donâ€™t want to dream that things are crawling under my incision. I donâ€™t want to feel ashamed or embarrassed that I have no control over whatâ€™s happening with my anxiety level for one month a year. I want to get over it more than anyone else.</p>

<p>But hereâ€™s the thing, I canâ€™t right now. This is part of my story. This is what leads to the other eleven amazing months a year. This is what helped me to be the person I am today, a person who is better than that person three years ago. For now, I need to accept that in exchange for those eleven great months a year, Iâ€™m going to have a bad one. Iâ€™m going to have panic attacks and a hard time concentrating. Iâ€™m going to be emotional in a way that I cannot control. Iâ€™m going to be frustrated.</p>

<p>Someone asked me last year at JSConf Hawaii if I could go back and do it all over, would I erase this experience, and the answer is a hard no. First, I wouldnâ€™t have my daughter who brings so much joy into our lives. Second, I wouldnâ€™t know how strong I am, how much I can overcome, I wouldnâ€™t understand empathy as I do now, and I wouldnâ€™t have met so many amazing people, whether in the coding community, local community, or those healing from trauma with me.</p>

<p>This is a part of my journey that I cannot change. This is the part that I need to accept where I am at, because mental health isnâ€™t a thing that I can magically snap my fingers at and be better. Even Frodo felt the pain of the blade where he was stabbed by the Witch-king of Angmar every year. They say that Frodoâ€™s wound was as spiritual as it was physical. Itâ€™s easy to see how a physical wound heals, but the spiritual wound is something I carry inside. I need to give myself the grace to feel wounded this time of year. Would it be amazing if I wake up one year and donâ€™t have that wound? Absolutely. But for now, this is me accepting myself where Iâ€™m at.</p>
