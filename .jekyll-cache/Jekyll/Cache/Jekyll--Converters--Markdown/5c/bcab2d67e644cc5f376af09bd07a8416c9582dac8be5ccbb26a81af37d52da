I"é<p>Iâ€™ve seen a lot of tweets recently and been a part of a number of conversations with people in tech who are interested in joining a DevRel team or applying for a community position, but donâ€™t know how to get the experience to do that. Iâ€™ve thought a lot about that, and I have some tips for getting experience that you can represent on a resume. Iâ€™ll be focusing specifically on community in this post, but feel free to drop some tips for DevRel experience in the comments.</p>
