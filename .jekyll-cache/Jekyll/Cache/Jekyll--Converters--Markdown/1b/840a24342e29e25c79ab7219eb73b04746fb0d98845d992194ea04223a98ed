I"¿<p>One of the things Iâ€™ve really enjoyed about learning TensorFlow.js (TFJS) is how quickly you can get it up and running and how many existing projects you can use as well. As someone learning about models and datasets and things like neural networks that havenâ€™t been a normal part of my vocabulary, I appreciate not having to be mentally exhausted with the costs of learning a new world of information as I explore this new technology.</p>
