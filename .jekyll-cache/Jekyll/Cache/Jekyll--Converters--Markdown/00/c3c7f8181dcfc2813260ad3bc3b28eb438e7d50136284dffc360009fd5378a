I"þ<p>As of June 1st, Iâ€™m no longer with the Linux Foundation. While Iâ€™ll share more details about this transition in a future post, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what comes next.</p>

<p>Going through an acquisition is intense, especially when youâ€™re leaving what was truly your favorite job. The experience has been both professionally enriching and personally challenging, and Iâ€™ve realized how important it is to give yourself permission to pause and process major changes rather than immediately jumping into the next thing.</p>

<p>So thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™m doing this summer: taking a pragmatic approach to my career and family life. Iâ€™m giving myself time to breathe, to explore opportunities I didnâ€™t have bandwidth for before, and to be intentional about my next steps.</p>

<p>My primary focus for the coming months will be diving deep into AI tools and their practical applications. Iâ€™ve been wanting to explore more AI tools, but I havenâ€™t had the time to until now. As someone whoâ€™s spent considerable time thinking about content strategy and audience development, Iâ€™m fascinated by how AI is reshaping not just what we create, but how we create it.</p>

<p>You can expect a lot of AI-related content from me in the weeks ahead. I donâ€™t have an exact plan mapped out, so it might be everything from tool reviews and practical use cases to my thoughts on how these technologies are changing the content landscape.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll have more to share about my long-term plans soon, but for now, Iâ€™m embracing this period of exploration. Thanks for following along on this journey. The next few months should be interesting.</p>
