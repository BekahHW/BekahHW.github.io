I";<p>Friends, it’s been hard. Everything’s been hard for everyone. We’re struggling to fight despair, to dream of a future, to stay motivated. We’re losing our jobs, our “normal,” our hope. We’re trying our best and somehow that doesn’t seem like enough. And if you’re like me, you’re trying to do whatever you can to keep moving forward, to feel like you’ve accomplished just one thing this week. And my friends say, “Bekah, you have accomplished things. You’ve interviewed, done coding challenges, applied for jobs, homeschooled your kids, and worked out.” And somehow that doesn’t feel like I’ve done anything at all. It feels like I’m stuck and I can’t focus and I’m not making progress, and I’m judging myself based on what I think I should be doing. And I’ve felt this before.</p>
