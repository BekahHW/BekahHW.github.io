I"™<p>Recently, I learned about Googleâ€™s EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) framework. Thatâ€™s the one that determines whether your content is worthy of showing up on search results or if it gets yeeted into the void of page two or beyond.</p>

<p>The more I thought about it, the more I realized that EEAT is just Aristotleâ€™s rhetorical triangle with an SEO-friendly name.</p>

<p>The humor isnâ€™t lost on me that same guy who spent his days philosophizing in ancient Greece (who I learned about in my Freshman Philosophy class) basically laid the groundwork for Googleâ€™s ranking algorithm. And if that doesnâ€™t prove that everything in life is a remix, I donâ€™t know what does.</p>

<p>But letâ€™s break this down in a way that is useable for content creators.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-eeat">What Is EEAT?</h2>
<p>In Googleâ€™s world, EEAT stands for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Experience</strong> â€“ Have you actually done the thing youâ€™re writing about?</li>
  <li><strong>Expertise</strong> â€“ Do you know your stuff?</li>
  <li><strong>Authoritativeness</strong> â€“ Are you recognized as a legit source?</li>
  <li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> â€“ Can people rely on your content?</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, if youâ€™re writing about deep-sea welding, Google wants to make sure youâ€™re not my 10 year old who just watched a YouTube video about it and decided, â€œYeah, I could generate a bunch words on this using ChatGPT.â€</p>

<h2 id="aristotles-rhetorical-triangle-the-og-eeat">Aristotleâ€™s Rhetorical Triangle: The OG EEAT</h2>

<p>Long before Google existed (or the internet, or electricity, or deodorant), Aristotle defined the three pillars of persuasion:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ethos (Credibility)</strong> â€“ Are you a trustworthy source?</li>
  <li><strong>Pathos (Emotion)</strong> â€“ Can you connect with peopleâ€™s lived experiences?</li>
  <li><strong>Logos (Logic)</strong> â€“ Do you have facts to back up what youâ€™re saying?</li>
</ul>

<p>Sound familiar? Thatâ€™s because itâ€™s basically EEAT in a different era.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how they match up:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>EEAT (Google)</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Aristotleâ€™s Triangle</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Experience</strong> (Have you actually done this?)</td>
      <td><strong>Pathos</strong> (Can you connect with real-life experiences?)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Expertise</strong> (Do you understand the topic deeply?)</td>
      <td><strong>Logos</strong> (Do you have the knowledge and logic to back it up?)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Authoritativeness &amp; Trustworthiness</strong> (Are you credible and reliable?)</td>
      <td><strong>Ethos</strong> (Are you a respected and believable source?)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If Aristotle were alive today, heâ€™d probably have a wildly successful blog, rank #1 on Google for How to Win an Argument, and be giving TED Talks about persuasion.</p>

<h2 id="seo-is-just-rhetoric-for-the-internet-age">SEO Is Just Rhetoric for the Internet Age</h2>

<p>The more you think about it, the more it makes sense. Google isnâ€™t just rewarding well-researched content; itâ€™s rewarding persuasive content.</p>

<p>Just like Aristotleâ€™s rhetoric, SEO is about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowing your audience (Google calls this â€œsearch intentâ€)</li>
  <li>Establishing credibility (Google calls this â€œauthorityâ€)</li>
  <li>Making a strong case (Google calls this â€œquality contentâ€)</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, writing for SEO is about being convincing, trustworthy, and valuable. Just like a good argument, or, a well-structured ancient Greek debate.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-you">What Does This Mean for You?</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re trying to write content that actually ranks, take a page from Google and Aristotle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Share real experiences. (People can smell fake authority from a mile away.)</li>
  <li>Back up your claims with solid knowledge. (Google loves receipts.)</li>
  <li>Build credibility over time. (Trust isnâ€™t built in a day.)</li>
</ul>

<p>But whatâ€™s most important, in my opinion? Write for people. Be engaging. Tell a story. Drop a joke now and then. Because at the end of the day, whether youâ€™re Aristotle in 350 BCE or a content creator in 2025, the best way to win people over is to be real, be knowledgeable, and make it worth their time.</p>
