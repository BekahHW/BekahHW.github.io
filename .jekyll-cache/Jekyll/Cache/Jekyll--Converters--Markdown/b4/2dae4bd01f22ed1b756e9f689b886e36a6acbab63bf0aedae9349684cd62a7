I"«<p>Itâ€™s been a year since Iâ€™ve started coding. December 6th is my one year GitHub-iversary, and December 11th, is my six month anniversary with Flatiron School. Itâ€™s amazing to reflect on the last year and all Iâ€™ve learned and the communities that Iâ€™ve found around me. Iâ€™ve found people who support me, make me laugh, and listen to me when Iâ€™m frustrated or when I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™ve found a new passion for a journey I never expected to takeâ€“a beautiful new world that I am so excited to explore. In honor of these anniversaries, Iâ€™ve come up with my top ten list of things Iâ€™ve learned and found meaningful as a Code Newbie.</p>

<h2 id="find-an-experienced-developer-whos-willing-to-mentor-you">Find an experienced developer whoâ€™s willing to mentor you.</h2>
<p>When youâ€™re new, you sometimes feel nervous, or awkward, or too ashamed to ask questions. If you have someone you trust, that comfort will come and it will feel so much easier.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq5ORvQB2ng/">This instagram post says it all</a>.</p>

<h2 id="find-the-program-that-works-best-for-your-learning">Find the program that works best for your learning.</h2>
<p>If youâ€™ve followed or read anything about my journey, you know that <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>, has been at the top of my list in terms of coding schools and resources. I tried a number of other programsâ€“see <a href="https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2018/03/24/The-Dating-Game-Learning-to-Code,-part-I">this post</a> and <a href="https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2018/03/30/The-Dating-Game-Learning-to-Code,-part-II">this post</a>â€“ and Flatironâ€™s program has always been the best for my learning style and has given me the community and push that I need.</p>

<h2 id="find-a-community-that-supports-all-your-needs">Find a community that supports all your needs.</h2>
<p>Not only do I have Flatiron School, I also have <a href="www.momscancode.com">Moms Can: Code</a>. This co-learning group has  supported me both as a Code Newbie and as a mom. There are so many challenges that come with motherhood. Adding career change and becoming a woman in tech seems like a lot. But with this group, everything seems possible.</p>

<h2 id="dont-sell-yourself-short">Donâ€™t sell yourself short.</h2>
<p>It frequently feels like Iâ€™ve learned nothing. But if I force myself to look back a year ago, I can see that I didnâ€™t even know the difference between frontend and backend, I had no idea what Ruby was, and I was still a part-time college English teacher. Reflecting on where you were a week, month, or year ago has helped me to focus on how far Iâ€™ve come.</p>

<h2 id="make-google-your-bff">Make Google your bff.</h2>
<p>Even the best programmers have to look things up. Learn early that this should be part of your everyday life. Consider it a favor if your coding program forces you to find outside resources to help you solve the problem. And donâ€™t even feel bad for having to look something up.</p>

<h2 id="make-connections">Make connections.</h2>
<p>One of the greatest parts of becoming part of the tech world has been meeting people on social media and at conferences. This growing network contains a wealth of information that I could never find as a mom of four young kids in a small town.</p>

<h2 id="talk-through-your-code-aloud">Talk through your code aloud.</h2>
<p>One of the most terrifying parts of coding is explaining my code to someone else. When I have project reviews I have to walk someone through my code, refactor, and answer any questions. Iâ€™m going to be really honest here: last time I totally froze. She didnâ€™t ask any of the things I had studied and expected, and my heart shatter into nineteen million pieces and then each of the pieces ran in a different direction. But practicing talking about your code aloud can help you to see where the gaps are. You can say things like, â€œI wrote this code to do X and it connects to Y, which is Z.â€ If you donâ€™t know what those variables are, you know you have some more studying to do. But if you have the chance, itâ€™s even better if you can find a more experienced dev who will listen to you walk through it.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-consistent">Keep it consistent.</h2>
<p>One of the hardest things to do is to walk away from the code for a while and then come back to it days or weeks later. If you donâ€™t exercise that coding muscle, it starts to fade away. Someone asked me how I do it with four kids, and the short answer is that I try to schedule in the time everyday and Iâ€™m disciplined about it. You can watch my video response <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o86Vr16FFnk&amp;t=2s">here</a>. Iâ€™ve coded everyday since January 1, 2018. I kept thinking Iâ€™d take a break, but I never did. And Iâ€™m ok with that.</p>

<h2 id="find-meaning-behind-your-drive">Find meaning behind your drive.</h2>
<p>There are few things better than doing a job you love and getting paid for it. Iâ€™m not there yet, but I love coding and thinking about how my code can affect the future. For me, Iâ€™ve always been driven by the desire to help people, and I see a clear connection between coding and helping marginalized groups. So on the tough days, or the days where my house is a disaster and I think I should really be doing something about that, I focus on why Iâ€™m doing it.</p>

<h2 id="theres-room-for-creativity-in-every-aspect-of-coding">Thereâ€™s room for creativity in every aspect of coding.</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s important to me that I merge my background in the humanities with my new career trajectory. And for some reason, thereâ€™s a whisper out there that says coding isnâ€™t creative, that if you arenâ€™t doing frontend or UI, that thereâ€™s little room for creativity. But coding is storytelling, just in a different language. Itâ€™s the media we consume. It helps us to define who we are to others. And when you create something, youâ€™re taking a user along for the journey that you defined. Your methods are your poetry, and your program is your novel.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve never been the smartest person in the room, but I have been the hardest worker or the most determined to achieve a goal. This past year I rediscovered the confidence and passion that had been snuffed out by a single moment in my life two years ago. And this journey that Iâ€™m on has been an amazing eye-opener into the possibilities of what life can be, of who I can be, and of the communities that I can be a part of. So thank you for being a part of that.</p>
