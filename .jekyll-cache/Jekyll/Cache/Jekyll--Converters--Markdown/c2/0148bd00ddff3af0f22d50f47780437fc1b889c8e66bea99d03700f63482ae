I"–<p>A couple of months ago I wrote about the <a href="https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2018/06/07/The-Coder's-Journey-The-Ordinary-World">Coderâ€™s Journey</a>, and one of the most important parts of any journey is finding a mentor. This might be the person who hands you the sword to defeat the dragon or gives you the confidence to tackle the error on your screen. But finding a mentor isnâ€™t a matter of asking a random person. You need to find someone who can understand you and your needs. It needs to be a person who is fully willing and capable to help you with your needs. Finding a mentor who fits into your journey could be a big part of your story.</p>
