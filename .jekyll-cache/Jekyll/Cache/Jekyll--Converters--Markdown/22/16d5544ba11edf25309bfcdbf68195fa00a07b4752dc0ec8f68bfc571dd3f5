I"Š<p>If Iâ€™ve learned anything from going through a trauma, itâ€™s that it takes time to heal, you have to be patient with yourself, and that community matters. And I canâ€™t help but re-experience what I went through before now, but with everyone else experiencing it along with me. And itâ€™s weird because weâ€™re all experiencing this in different ways, whether we have kids home now, weâ€™ve lost our jobs, weâ€™ve not been able to take care of loved ones, or weâ€™ve enjoyed a slowed pace and had opportunities to reconnect with others; weâ€™re all experiencing it differently. But one of the hardest parts about going through trauma, is the feeling of being isolated. Before, I thought I was the only one who had gone through a birth trauma like I hadâ€“I wasnâ€™t far off, it was extremely rare. Now, the world around me is experiencing trauma. But that doesnâ€™t mean we donâ€™t feel isolated.</p>
