I"²<p>This post is going to reveal how inexperienced I am. About six weeks ago, I decided I was going to build a blog with Jekyll and host it with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. I have no idea why. Iâ€™m sure I mustâ€™ve heard it in a podcast, or article, or tweet. I mean, the name is pretty cool, but I prefer Gatsby over Jekyll if weâ€™re talking names. Anyway, I started by creating the the blog without installing a bundler, and until a couple of weeks ago, I didnâ€™t have any gem files in the repo. I was going off of a layout in a tutorial, and I had only a vague idea of what markdown is. Go ahead, call me names, shake your head, but donâ€™t stop reading.</p>
