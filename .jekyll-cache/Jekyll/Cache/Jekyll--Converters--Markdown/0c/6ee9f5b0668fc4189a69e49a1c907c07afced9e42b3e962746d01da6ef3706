I"£<p>During the pandemic, I occupied the same spaceâ€”a Zoom room-with members of the Virtual Coffee community from all over the world. Weâ€™ve had members across the US, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. We saw each other whether in an official Virtual Coffee even or eventually in our virtual co-working room that stayed open 24/7. Sometimes weâ€™d chat. Sometimes, weâ€™d justâ€¦ exist together.</p>
