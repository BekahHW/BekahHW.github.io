I"£<p>Over the past year, we‚Äôve had a ton of conversations at <a href="http://virtualcoffee.io/">Virtual Coffee</a> about AI. If you‚Äôve opened up X or LinkedIn, you probably realize that people have very strong opinions about AI. At Virtual Coffee, we‚Äôre a pretty close-knit community, so there are a lot of concerns about the impacts of AI, how junior developers grow (or stay stagnant) with AI, whether or not to adopt it as a team, and whether to use it without telling your boss. At the heart of a lot of these conversations is the feeling that you‚Äôre somehow ‚Äúcheating‚Äù if you use AI, and that you won‚Äôt learn or grow if you‚Äôre using it. I think the sentiment comes from the right place, caring about people, but I think there are a lot of options and approaches you can take to prevent that. I believe that when we consider the evolving landscape in tech, we also need to think about the changing landscape of tech education. Most of us will end up using AI in our workflow, either out of necessity or because our team mandates it. That‚Äôs why I also think that AI coding assistants actually have the ability to help everyone grow in ways they couldn‚Äôt before.</p>
