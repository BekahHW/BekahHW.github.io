I"Š<p>If you look back at my <a href="https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2018/03/30/The-Dating-Game-Learning-to-Code,-part-II">second blog post</a>, youâ€™ll see that <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a> was my first love that I hoped I might come back to someday. And Iâ€™m so happy to write that Iâ€™m the recipient of the of a Facebook + Flatiron School Breakthrough Scholarship, and Iâ€™ll be coming back to my first love. But thereâ€™s more to this story. Flatiron School has been an incredible part of my healing journey, and with this scholarship, I feel like Iâ€™m at the highest point in my recovery because they said yes.</p>
