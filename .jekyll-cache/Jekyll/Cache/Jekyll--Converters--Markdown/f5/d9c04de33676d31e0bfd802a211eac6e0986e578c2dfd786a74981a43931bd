I"…<p>Iâ€™ve been a dev for six months. Most days, I still think Iâ€™m going to get fired. I think Iâ€™m not good enough. I think I should know more. But thatâ€™s kind of my MO. I always think Iâ€™m not doing as well as I should be doing. It is not a reflection on the people I work with or anyone around me. Itâ€™s how I push myself. There are some days where the self-doubt is worse than others. Those are usually the days where I spend hours trying to track down what exactly is going on with this code Iâ€™m working on. And there are other days where I remind myself of how far Iâ€™ve come.</p>

<p>Early on in my job, I was pretty stuck, so I sent a message asking for a little direction. â€œWhy donâ€™t you share what you have and we can talk through it?â€ Nope. No. No thank you. Yes, I refused to share my code with my boss, saying that it was too messy right now. I have a coding method that might not work for everyone and in the beginning, it was super messy. I sometimes throw everything at my code editor and wait to see what sticks. I comment one thing out and then another. I have about a million and a half console.logs and Iâ€™m not even sure if what I have written reflects anything that anyone who has any coding training would ever put up. Now you can probably better understand why Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t been fired yet.</p>

<p>Recently, someone asked me the great question, â€œWhen do you know when to ask for help?â€ I donâ€™t have a great answer for this. Once, someone told me that if I were stuck for twenty-minutes, I should ask for help. But recently, Iâ€™ve found that trying to hunt through all of the files and to understand what was happening in each file takes a much longer time than twenty minutes. So for me, the goal is to keep searching until Iâ€™ve run out of options. I take notes. I map things out. I write out check-boxes. I do what I have to, to learn.</p>

<p>Before I got a job, I pretty strongly believed I wouldnâ€™t get a dev job, and that React would never be my thing. Since Iâ€™ve started, Iâ€™ve not only learned hooks, Iâ€™ve learned storybook.js, how to write tests, how to better think through logic when Iâ€™m using React. Iâ€™ve learned when to ask questions and when to trust that I need to give myself a little bit more time. Iâ€™m lucky to be in a supportive work environment, where Iâ€™m encouraged to learn, grow, and ask questions.</p>

<p>Six months as a dev has taught me that every day is a new challenge. It will take me longer to figure out a problem than it will for someone whoâ€™s been coding for three years. I think about it like this: when I had a one-year-old, they were learning to talk, string a couple of words together, and to walk without falling. But now at three, my youngest can hold whole conversations, climb up playground equipment and say the word Mandalorian. Thereâ€™s less awkwardness in their steps and language.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t use â€œfive-syllable wordsâ€ in my code yet, but Iâ€™m working on smoothing out my syntax. Iâ€™m thinking more clearly about what each piece does and how other devs will understand my code  Sometimes I need hand-holding. Sometimes I surprise myself. But the last six months have been the best of my life, and coding is certainly a part of that. And now, I look forward to walking through my code and talking about it. Because itâ€™s more about growing and learning to see new things than how my code compares to anyone elseâ€™s.</p>
