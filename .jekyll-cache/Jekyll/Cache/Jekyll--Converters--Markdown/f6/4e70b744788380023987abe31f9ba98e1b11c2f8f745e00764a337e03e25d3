I"q<p>There are stages of learning. There are stages of being part of a community. This morning I went back and reread my <a href="https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2018/05/09/I'm-a-Mother-Coder">blog post from last Motherâ€™s Day</a>, and most of what I wrote still stands. So today I want to talk about something different. I want to talk about why coding is for moms.</p>
