I"³<p>Some weeks, youâ€™ll have a lot of tangible checkmarks on your to-do list. Other weeks, it feels like you havenâ€™t done anything. Still, in reality, youâ€™ve spent a lot of time planning for things in the future, thinking deliberatelyâ€“rather than just reactingâ€“about the people in your community, their needs, and how you can support them as the community builder for your own community. This is one of those weeks for me.</p>
