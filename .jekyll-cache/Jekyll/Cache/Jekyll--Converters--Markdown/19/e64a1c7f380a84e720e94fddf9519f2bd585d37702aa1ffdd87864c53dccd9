I"£<p>Once you understand variables, youâ€™re ready to dive into classes and objects. A class, in simple terms, is like a blueprint for objects. I like to think of it as an overall storage center for things of a same type. For example, Iâ€™m working on a program for my moms group where I need information about moms and student helpers. It might make sense for me to have a mom class in order to organize all of the instances of moms and a student class to organize my instances of students. An instance is a particular occurrence of an object. Within each class, Iâ€™ll have instances of moms, which is really information about one particular mom. So instance = specific.</p>
