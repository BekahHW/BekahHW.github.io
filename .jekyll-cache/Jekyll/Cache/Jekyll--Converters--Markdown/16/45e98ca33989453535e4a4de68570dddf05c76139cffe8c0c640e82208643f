I"z<p>It’s been a week since my first full, IRL conference, and my mind is still exploding. Special thanks to the wonderful organizers from <a href="https://revolutionconf.com/">Revolution Conference</a> for the diversity ticket. Without it, I wouldn’t have a renewed drive to learn as much as I can as fast as I can. I can’t stop talking about how much I learned, hence this blog and the webinar–Chart your Territory: how to make the most out of your conference– I’m giving June 7, 12:30EST. (I’ll post the link when I have it.) But this post isn’t about that; it’s a list of my top five reasons newbies should attend conferences.</p>

<h2 id="find-your-focus">Find your focus</h2>
<p>I’ve been learning JavaScript since the fall, and I’ve really enjoyed its potential applications, but wow, was my mind blown by Guy Royse’s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4HJi4N1HsQ&amp;t=11s">ML for Gamers: Dungeon Forecasts and Dragon Regressions</a>. Up to this point, I knew little to nothing about ML, but now I know it needs to find a place in my life. His wasn’t the only talk that helped me to see a larger world of tech. A number of other great talks helped me to understand subtleties and nuances I hadn’t considered. I left the talks having a clearer focus of application.</p>

<h2 id="find-your-mentors">Find your mentors</h2>
<p>A mentor doesn’t have to be a life-long partner. A mentor can hand you the weapon you need with a couple of words of confidence and then send you on your way to slay the dragon. In the same way, a conference welcomes mentorship in every moment you have to network. Ask the people at your breakfast table about their favorite resources, stories, or experiences. I even got some great gardening mentorship. (Be prepared for a summer of tomatoes and carrots next to my laptop on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bekahhw/">Instagram</a>).</p>

<h2 id="find-your-people">Find your people</h2>
<p>I was incredibly lucky to meet a <a href="momscancode.com">Moms Can: Code</a> member at the conference for the first time IRL. Together, we met a great group of women who were able to talk about the challenges we face as mothers or working while woman. I expanded my support network, and gained confidence by talking to women already in the field. And they rocked.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-yourself-for-job-seeking">Prepare yourself for job-seeking</h2>
<p>I’m not at the point where I’m looking for a job, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t approached by recruiters. This was a no-stakes game for me and really good practice. The next conference I go to when I’m job-ready, I’ll have a better idea of what to expect.</p>

<h2 id="its-a-damn-good-time">It’s a damn good time</h2>
<p>I don’t get out much, so this was the best time I’ve had in months. Even my fellow introverts came out to have a good time. One of the best parts was the openness and honesty they all brought to the table. We talked code, life, and living, and I feel like a better person after meeting them.</p>

<p>If you have the chance to conference, take it. If you can’t afford it, don’t forget about it. I could never have afforded the conference and travel, but I emailed the conference organizers to see if they had diversity tickets. And I was lucky enough to build community to sustain me when I’m frustrated, celebrate my successes, and laugh with me when I have no idea what I’m doing.</p>
